"Die Grundidee dieser Firma ist ausgezeichnet: Sie bietet volle Autonomie hinsichtlich Arbeitszeit und Pensum – ein grosser Pluspunkt, insbesondere für Studierende. Die Aufgaben sind inhaltlich anspruchsvoll und können je nach Projekt echtes Fachwissen, etwa in Mathematik oder Physik, erfordern – was die Tätigkeit über einfache Klickarbeit hinaushebt.

Allerdings gibt es auch einige strukturelle Schwächen, die nicht unerwähnt bleiben sollten:

- Bezahlt wird ausschliesslich für offiziell zugewiesene Tasks. Zeit, die für Einrichtung, Onboardings, Assessments, Screenings oder troubleshooting aufgewendet wird, bleibt unvergütet, was sich insbesondere bei längeren Einarbeitungsphasen negativ bemerkbar macht.
- Der Kontakt zum Support erfolgt ausschliesslich über ein Ticket-System. Persönliche Ansprechpartner oder kurzfristige Hilfe gibt es nicht. In meinem Fall führten lange Wartezeiten auf Rückmeldungen (teils über eine Woche) zu erheblichen Opportunitätskosten.
- Nach der Registrierung ist es nicht möglich, die E-Mail-Adresse zu ändern. Geht der Zugang einmal verloren, besteht keine Möglichkeit zur Wiederherstellung. Da die ""Company policy"" verbietet einen Zweit-Account zu haben, darf, wer seinen Zugang verliert, nicht mehr bei Outlier arbeiten.
- Das gesamte System wirkt stark anonymisiert. Feedback kommt aus dem Nichts, der Einstieg erfolgt ohne persönliche Begleitung oder konkrete Ansprechperson. Auch nach gewisser Erfahrung bleibt der Kontakt meist auf einen ""Squad Leader"" beschränkt. Solange alles funktioniert, ist das hinnehmbar – bei Problemen jedoch ist man schnell auf sich allein gestellt, was erneut zu langen Wartezeiten führt, die selbstverständlich nicht vergütet werden.",Grundsätzlich ein vielversprechendes Konzept – mit Luft nach oben in der Umsetzung,2,de,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/686773d1e4786546631ae52b

"The platform has some of the worst UX I have ever experienced but the income has been a lifeline to me at a difficult time.

Support for users is minimal at times and the onboarding varies greatly in quality. Projects feel a bit experimental and rushed. Getting help is sometimes very difficult, and they mess you around by terminating projects while you're in the middle of a task. Many projects are deliberately difficult to qualify for.

But they pay you! And you can earn decent money working on the platform. Also in fairness they have a very good support team for payment-related issues.","Bad UX, genuine source of income",4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/685eb00b31ced90259e33a15

"I have earned a fair bit on this platform, but it’s also hugely stressful due to platform issues, precarity, and poor management. It’s chaotic, which is probably why the pay is so high - you wouldn’t tolerate the issues for less pay.

Pros: 
- The pay is good (though varies considerably between projects).

- You can work when you want (when work is available).

- Never had an issue with being paid. 

Cons: 
- You’re just a number, the platform churns through workers and you mean nothing to the management.

- You can’t get a reference etc for future employment - this may as well be a blank space on your CV.

- Work availability is precarious and unstable, which is very stressful.

- You can be dropped from a project and left with no work with zero explanation, also very stressful.

- Promotion to higher responsibility roles doesn’t come with better pay.

- Assessment of work is often very subjective, has to be disputed, and can unfairly lead to loss of work.

- Training and assessments are unpaid, often last hours, and don’t always lead to work.

- Training and assessments are poorly designed, making it difficult to meet quality standards, leading to a loss of work.

- You are often “throttled” to a couple of tasks a day after completing hours of training and assessments.

- You can be switched to a different project you were stable and earning good money on without explanation, and forced to do more unpaid training etc for a new project.

- Contributors are often left to figure things out between themselves, including the rules and expectations of the project.

- Trying to clarify issues or get support from management is patchy at best.

- Management frequent seem unclear on what the expectations of a project are, as do the clients (tech companies) commissioning the work.
 
- Nobody on the platform takes responsibility for mistakes or poor management.

- The platform itself is broken, with constant tech issues leading to loss of work, accidental removal from projects, etc. 

Summary: you can earn money on Outlier, but you also have to give up a lot of time with no reward or pay. The work is precarious and unreliable. The platform is riddled with tech issues. Everything is poorly managed. All of this makes it very stressful and demoralising. I think the high pay is to make up for all of this. It almost does - when you can actually work.

"The platform is okay – probably works fine for freelancing here and there – but it’s not nearly as good as it makes itself out to be.
If your account gets stuck or paused, there’s no way to get it back or recover your money, since they don’t want users to open more than one account.

I’m also skeptical about all these reviews. I usually don’t trust a site that has either all 1-star or 5-star reviews with nothing in between. It feels like the company had a wave of complaints and then went on the defensive with planted reviews. Who’s to say it’s not even a task on the platform to “go leave a 5-star review and get a bonus”?

Either way, tread carefully when joining a platform like this. It’s not really mainstream yet, and you never know what people might be hiding behind the scenes.",Paid reviews? ,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/685bfc87d6d29d9acfc607f1
"An absolutely outrageous experience. This company shows no respect for professionals' time. They fail candidates based on arbitrary criteria without offering any meaningful feedback, even when you're confident, as a subject matter expert, that your assessment responses were excellent.

The chatbot support is useless, offering only generic, canned responses with no real assistance. Overall, a frustrating waste of time and a display of unprofessionalism.

"The platform is chaotic and no one stands up or owns anything.

You'll just get bot-like responses stating that task will only be paid unless they are submitted in completion.

It’s not just about completing tasks; it’s about contributing meaningfully to something smarter.

The positive parts include the fact that every task you complete is rewarding, the instructions of the project are good, and the payment is also on time. If you are given tasks to do and you work hard, you can enjoy the flexible working hours and work from home.
However, there is a downside, that you will never feel safe or as though you belong. You always passively start a new project by taking courses and assessments. Not only is there no pay for the onboarding process, but there is also no guarantee that you will get a task after spending hours passing the assessments. It's common to spend more than three hours passing the onboarding process, only for the project to show ""Not available"", ""Pause"", or ""Max capacity"". But the most disappointing thing is that a situation could suddenly arise without warning.

- Challenged me to be creative with writing prompts.
- Could use my knowledge of Business, which I  learned from my Bachelor's Degree.
- Trustworthy structural weekly pay, always on Tuesday at the same time.
- You get structural feedback on your work.
- At some point, I got recognized for my work and got put in the elite (Oracle) team.
- There is a community where you can chat/seek help from other contributors.
- The onboarding for projects is thorough, which makes clear how a good contributor should work.
- The rates you get paid (in comparison to other similar organisations) are high.

Of course, there are some things I would like to see improved: 

- Communication with support, if you are experiencing issues, is quite slow. Especially because the work is task-based (paid per task), which means that if you are unable to work, you are not earning any money.
- In alignment with communication, if you don't have any assigned projects (you are out of tasks), you have no idea when you will get new tasks and what the volume is. Is it full-time work or just 5 hours per week? However, this is a part of the ""AI-training world"" and must be accepted.

Overall I really recommend Outlier, especially if you are looking for a job at your own pace, you decide how many hours and if you want to challenge yourself.

"I joined Outlier via a LinkedIn invitation, completed ID verification and Arabic language testing — all successfully approved.

Then… nothing.

For 5 days, no projects appeared. No access to the marketplace. I contacted support. They said they'd respond in 24 hours. A full week later, they finally replied — not with a fix, but with a disturbing message: my account was suspended due to “a connection with another identity.”

This makes zero sense. These are my real, personal details — never used on any other account. Their vague response raised red flags. I replied immediately. They responded 6 hours later with the same generic message, ignoring my explanation.

It’s been 8 days since, and still no response. My account remains suspended. My ID documents and personal data are in their hands. No transparency. No due process. No accountability.

This behavior is highly suspicious. It feels like they’re collecting identity documents under false pretenses and ghosting users without any justification.

Even worse, when I tried to publicly comment on their Reddit posts and share my experience respectfully — I was banned from contributing altogether.

Why silence honest feedback if you're truly transparent? Why fear legitimate questions if you’re acting in good faith?

I have already filed a consumer protection report. I strongly urge others: think twice before uploading your sensitive documents to Outlier.

"Do not make an account! They sell your information. All 5 star reviews are from themselves.

On 18/12/2024, I opened my account on outlier on the recommendation of a friend. Initially, everything went smoothly, they asked behind my CV, personal information and I completed a language test (which took a lot longer than the time they stipulated).

Since it was already late that day and I wanted to start my first project with the necessary energy, I left the training that was ready for the next day.

But to my surprise, the training was gone the next day. When I contacted outlier, they said my account was temporarily blocked due to possible violation of their terms and conditions and that the investigation would only take a week.

I heard nothing more from them and I had then also posted a review here on trustpilot to which they had replied that it was probably a bug and they would look into it. Weeks went by and I kept getting no updates. So just a reminder, I haven't done anything at all on the site outside of entering my personal information! So it is not even possible that I would have broken a rule.

A while later I received an email from them which said the following:
Your account was flagged for violating Outlier’s Community Guidelines and/or Terms of Use. After reviewing your account, we have determined that it will not be reactivated.

""Please note the following:
-You can still access your account to review past information.
-Any pending earnings will be processed as usual.
-You will not be matched with new projects.

If you believe this decision was made in error, you may submit a new ticket for further review. Please include specific and detailed information that may clarify or provide context about your account activity.""

In other words, no information at all about which rule I would have broken (because there isn't any at all, I went through everything again). How can I now defend myself in a new ticket if I am not even given as information against which I should defend myself?

Apparently, I am not alone in this. I started with others and most of them ended up in the exact same situation before they could even start. Only a small number can start and earn something in the long run. Those few are naturally going to attract other people to the site who in turn leave their sensitive information which they can sell for a lot of money.

On my previous review, they said this claim is unfounded? But the reason for my ban is also unfounded? I see no other logical explanation for banning people for no reason (and even no explanation) than that you guys are after illegal activities.

I would very much like a further explanation from you guys, but I fear that as with others, I will hear nothing more from you.

I had also immidiately send a mail to ask for what rule I breached so I know what I have to defend myself from, but they just copy pasted the exact same thing again.

Stay away, they are a fraud! They also flag all negative reviews in hopes of getting them removed.

"Review:
I've been working with Outlier for several months and can confirm it's a legitimate platform that actually pays contributors. Payments have been consistent and reliable.

What works well:
• Payments are processed as promised - no issues with getting paid for completed work
• Variety of projects available across different skill sets
• Flexible work schedule that fits around other commitments
• Platform is genuine and not a scam, contrary to some online claims

Areas for improvement:
• Communication could be clearer regarding project requirements and expectations
• The onboarding process could be more streamlined
• Sometimes there are gaps between available projects
• Interface could be more user-friendly

"Working on Outlier is great for a number of reasons, the pay is fantastic and the terms for each project are straight-forward and easy to understand, time limits are very generous, and they actively offer career advancement opportunities to high quality contributors.
There are issues with the platform, specifically with oboarding materials and instructions falling out of sync, but there are mechanisms in place that minimize the effect of these issues, and they're always improving. 
The only thing I think needs to be mentioned, is that due to the fact that there is no direct productivity monitoring, you are only paid for the time spent on tasks that you actually submit. Skipping, or otherwise letting a task expire discards the data you generated during the task, and obviously does not result in you receiving a payment. This has never really been an issue for me, but I do understand that some people may fall victim to this sort of thing and believe they have been scammed out of their time. However, there is no real way to circumvent a system like this, since paying out for expired tasks or giving people infinite time to complete tasks would incentivize idling and spam in a way that would quickly kill the platform.

I have been full time since I graduated two months ago (50$/hr before bonuses, 70+/hr avg after bonuses) with less than two total days of downtime between projects, but there is always the looming possibility of the english language coding projects drying up, but layoffs happen in every industry, so it's not actually much different than working in an internal position at any tech company.",Oracle Coder Experience,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6844b6d0b08308661870acd1

The tasks can be complex and challenging, but that’s part of what makes it exciting. You’re constantly learning, thinking critically, and growing intellectually. It’s a place for hard work, yes, but also for deep learning and real personal growth.

The support team has also been amazing. I had a few issues in the beginning, but they were super kind and responsive, always ready to help. That kind of support really matters when you’re starting something new.

"I've now been working on Outlier for over three months and I've worked on an amazing variety of tasks/projects. The most striking thing about Outlier is how straightforward and simple everything is:

Clear instructions: All the tasks/projects provide step-by-step directions, so all expectations are clearly set from the start.

Quick, sure payments: Payments arrive quickly and securely as anticipated. No unexpected charges or sluggish delays.

Helpful feedback: There is always feedback provided by experienced contributors for each task/project and hence, you learn and improve over time.

Supportive community: There is a vibrant Outlier community where you can ask questions, receive answers.  It makes the experience feel collaborative rather than isolating.

Responsive support team: In the rare need for immediate support, the team responded quickly and helpfully.

Something to work on: It would be great to experience a more consistent stream of work. Sometimes the queue will be empty for a few days, which can make it hard to rely on Outlier as a steady side income.

"I've been with Outlier for about a year now, and overall, I think it's a great side hustle if you manage your expectations. Don’t expect that by joining the platform, you're entitled to receiving projects consistently, and be prepared not to take it too personally to the point that it affects your mental health, if you receive unfair assessments or no work at all. At the end of the day, it’s a freelance gig, not a full-time commitment.

Pros:
- If you consistently provide high-quality work, there are chances to be included in the elite group, which can lead to more regular assignments.

- Depending on your location, the hourly rate can be quite good compared to other side hustles.

- They pay weekly—it’s satisfying to see your bank account grow every single week.

- Some projects are genuinely interesting and give you a chance to be creative.

Cons:
- The feedback/review system is flawed. Unfair assessments can be demoralizing and might negatively impact your quality score and chances of getting more work.

- Queue managers are contractors who often lack proper leadership training. While some are great, others struggle with their people's skill.

- There isn’t much flexibility in choosing projects. Assignments are typically decided for you, and with limited options available, you often end up working on less interesting tasks just to keep earning—but that’s life :)

- The environment can sometimes feel fear-based, with a constant uncertainty about losing access to work over just a couple of bad ratings.",A great side hustle with room for improvements,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68445129611e50bfa4f50751

And yes — Outlier does pay. On time, reliably, and fairly. There’s a lot of noise online about scams and shady platforms, but in my experience, Outlier is legit. I’ve hit a pretty decent milestone in earnings recently, and the communication from the team has been clear and professional throughout.

I have been working for half a year now with Outlier and must say I am very pleased. It’s a trustworthy company that always pays regularly for the work you do. The only thing that might be a problem is if you expect to have a regular income. The task you get is based on the project that is ordered by the customers.

"Outlier has been a significant opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience in the field of artificial intelligence, which is directly aligned with my current academic path(Bachelors in AI&Robotics). As someone who is actively studying AI, being able to contribute to real-world projects on this platform means a lot to me.
Secondly, Outlier has proven to be an excellent source of income. Working part-time, I’ve earned significantly more here than i could expected. If I were working full-time on Outlier, I wouldn’t need another job at all — I would be making several times more than needed per month while also being able to set aside savings regularly.What’s most impressive is that payments are always on time, calculated clearly and delivered exactly when promised — usually every Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on your time zone. This level of transparency and reliability is rare in online work, and it builds real trust. Of course, there are areas for improvement. One challenge I've experienced is inconsistent project availability, where there can be long pauses between tasks. This affects both income and momentum. That's why it is still quite hard to recommend work on Outlier as a main income for you. But i think it mostly depends on your role on platform. 
However, I’ve noticed Outlier is actively working on this by bringing in new clients and expanding opportunities.I also appreciate the platform’s recent structural improvements — especially the revamp of the review and quality control systems. The ability to dispute a review is a great addition, recognizing that human judgment can sometimes be subjective. Having the chance to explain your side and defend your work shows respect for contributors and makes the evaluation process more balanced.Finally, I want to highlight that Outlier is an incredibly fair and supportive platform. Mistakes are met with guidance rather than punishment. You're given the chance to improve, grow, and earn trust back — and I’ve personally experienced that. Over time, I’ve become better at what I do, and it shows in the level of responsibility I’m given now. If you’re passionate about working in AI — whether full-time or just as a side project — Outlier is absolutely worth your time. The platform provides real value, meaningful experience, and a professional yet human approach to collaboration.
This might sound like a promotion, but it’s not — I’m genuinely grateful that I came across this opportunity on LinkedIn, applied, and was accepted. I was immediately placed on a long-term, high-impact project, which gave me a huge amount of hands-on experience in AI evaluation as a contributor.
It was intense at first, especially as a newcomer, but it helped me understand both the demands and the value of this kind of work. It can be challenging at times — like any job — but because I’m truly passionate about AI, I chose to stay, explore other projects, and keep growing on the platform.
So if you have a similar background and interest, I honestly believe Outlier is worth trying.

PS: and since I’m now a professional contributor, I’ll do what I do best — evaluate.
I give the platform a 4 out of 5: I’ve noticed some minor issues, and I simply can’t give a perfect 5 — because 5 means excellent, and hey, nobody’s perfect.

The different projects also provide bonuses occasionally such as working for some hours until a certain date, which is cool.

"I have been a freelancer on Outlier for 2 months now and was honestly very skeptical at the beginning. I read all the negative reviews and wasn't sure how legit it was. But then I thought to myself, if they post their freelance jobs on LinkedIn, then it can't be that dubious, because what scam company does that? 

I successfully completed the very extensive assessment, did my first onboardings and trial tasks, got good feedback and was really busy for two months and never had an empty queue (i.e. no tasks). I also worked my way up relatively quickly, from a regular contributor, to reviewer, senior reviewer and finally to Oracle status (which you get if you have an average 4 out of 5 star rating on your tasks). 

If you do a good job on Outlier, you can earn a really nice income there. I was also paid on time every week, so everything was great. I'm really excited about this job and I'm glad I applied to Outlier because it's exactly what I'm looking for and it's even inspired me to move more towards computer science/AI in my career because I enjoy it so much. 

I can only explain the many negative reviews by the fact that the job is not for everyone. You have to work super precisely, follow the handbooks exactly, write excellently and be creative. The aim is to be better as a tasker than the existing AI. And since I was a reviewer myself and have seen many tasks from other contributors, I can say that only a few of them were high quality and met the standards that are sought on Outlier. It's not a “I'll make a bit of money on the side” gig, you really have to put in the work. 

I'm in the German-speaking groups and love the exchange there. A real community has developed there of people who have been working for Outlier for a long time and newbies like me. The QMs from Germany are also all super committed, approachable and helpful. Honestly, if I could make this my full-time job, I would be the happiest person, but of course it depends on the project situation. There's currently a longer empty queue period, so you have to put up with that. That's why we're all freelancers and not permanent employees.

"The good thing about Copilot is that it has a solid management system and a good communication platform to facilitate task completion. Payment for completing tasks is also very transparent.

The downside is the accuracy of task evaluation. Quality metrics can sometimes be vague, change frequently, or be unrealistically inevitable. Also, when a task is executed by multiple people working together, if one person commits an error that is very difficult to avoid, all three people will receive an extremely low evaluation. Even if attempters are removed from the project based on assessments made in the midst of such confusion, there is no accountability whatsoever, and in this case, I feel constructive cooperation is very difficult. 
I believe that evaluations of Attempters should not be carried out at a stage where the evaluation criteria are vague, unrealistically difficult, and the reviewer's subjectivity is large, but should be carried out after the direction of quality control has been determined and standards have been set objectively and realistically.","Good platform, but unfair evaluation",3,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6843e6fef9d266c9f89fc609
"I’ve been working on this platform for the last 7 months, and honestly, it’s been a great experience so far.

Let me start with the most important part - payments. They’re super smooth and reliable. Your earnings are credited to your PayPal account every Wednesday or Thursday (based on a Monday-to-Monday cycle), and the money usually arrives automatically within a day or two.

What I really appreciate is that even if you make a small mistake in a task, or there's an error, you still get paid. That kind of fairness is rare. The pay rate is fixed, which I find quite reasonable, and you always know what to expect.

The platform offers a wide range of projects. Even if you can’t clear the entrance test for one (though the tests are quite simple), you can easily switch to another. There’s always something to work on. Plus, you can take up tasks from different domains like Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, and more — all at the same time.

"The experience is overall good, and many projects and tasks are interesting. However, sometimes some bilingual CBs will be prohibited from doing some tasks for certain languages, although having the corresponding language skill.

For example, as a bilingual CB, I have both Japanese skills and Taiwanese skills (zh-TW), but I am not included in the Japanese group of stratus_drake_evals (Yonder), and I am only added to the (zh-TW) group. Therefore, I have no knowledge of the Japanese-specific rules for this project when the tasks are coming. In the normal situation, I should be added to the Japanese group of stratus_drake_evals (Yonder) group in the Outlier community, also. But I am directly prohibited from doing those Japanese tasks by the specific project QM, which seems to be a kind of discrimination!? I hope the QM can treat those bilingual CBs fairly.

And, those Japanese tasks from the stratus_drake_evals (Yonder) project keep popping up on my dashboard, which will hinder my ability and opportunity to carry out other projects. (BTW. Other projects are perfect, and they kindly allow me to conduct the tasks of both Japanese skills and Taiwanese skills (zh-TW) kindly, and I have been added to the project group in Outlier community also for both languages.)

"### **Pros:**

* **Competitive Compensation:**
  The remuneration package was generous and aligned well with industry standards, providing financial stability and recognition for the work performed.

### **Cons:**

* **Inadequate Task Review Process:**
  Submitted tasks were not thoroughly reviewed. In one instance, a task was flagged as being generated by a language model without substantial evidence or a comprehensive review.

* **Lack of Transparent Communication:**
  Decisions regarding project removals were made without clear explanations or justifications, leading to confusion and a sense of insecurity among team members.

* **Frequent System Downtime:**
  The operational model experienced multiple downtimes, disrupting workflow and affecting overall productivity.

### **Conclusion:**

While the company offers a commendable compensation structure, the experience is marred by operational inefficiencies and a lack of transparent communication. For future improvement, it is recommended that the company implements a more rigorous review process for submitted tasks, ensures transparent decision-making regarding project assignments, and addresses system reliability issues to enhance overall employee satisfaction and productivity.","Strong Compensation, but Operational Challenges Undermine Experience",3,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6843b9f83113584cb14509ad

"1. Lack of Public Information Before Joining
Before joining, I found it difficult to gather reliable information about the company. Although I applied with cautious optimism, I hesitated before completing the camera interview due to the lack of publicly available details. Even after extensive Googling, I came across very few firsthand accounts from current employees. Most of the posts I did find were from former workers, and many online questions asked things like, “Is Outlier legit?”

I understand that the company emphasizes confidentiality, especially regarding work-related content. However, I believe there should be clearer guidelines about what can be shared publicly. Encouraging people to document and share their personal experiences—within defined limits—on blogs or forums could improve transparency and trust without compromising security.

2. Insufficient Onboarding Support
The onboarding process was far from intuitive. After joining, I didn’t immediately start working, not because of personal delays, but because I had no idea how things functioned operationally. If there was any onboarding documentation or process, it wasn’t communicated or easy to locate.

Although we now use Discourse for communication, back then, Slack was the main tool. I remember spending several days piecing together how things worked by reading through Slack threads. I wasn’t alone; many others in a similar position repeatedly asked questions like, “Why am I EQ?” or “How do I get started?”

Some of these questions might have stemmed from people not reading the instructions properly, but others, myself included, genuinely didn’t know where to begin. From the perspective of existing CBs or QMs, these questions might have seemed too basic. But the fact that such basic information wasn’t readily available or obvious is a systemic inefficiency. In hindsight, I realize I was lucky to navigate those early days without any serious issues.

3. Lack of Transparency in Workflow and Evaluation
The current workflow feels unnecessarily opaque. I believe that opening up certain parts of the process, even in a limited or high-level way, could lead to significantly improved efficiency and clarity.

For example, it would be helpful to know roughly how much of a task has been completed, or whether late-joining CBs might still be EQ’d even after passing BM. Providing even this basic context would help set expectations and reduce confusion.

A large portion of online complaints seem to revolve around EQ status or account deactivation, with people unsure why they were removed or why they weren’t included in a project. If the guidelines clearly state that tasks may be closed without prior notice, and if the overall project status is shared more transparently, it could significantly reduce repetitive and unnecessary questions.

If there is a valid reason behind a decision, people deserve to be informed, even briefly. Accepting the outcome is ultimately the individual’s responsibility, but expecting workers to accept sudden changes with zero explanation can feel unfair, especially for CBs who are committed to doing their work properly and who aren’t trying to exploit the system.

"Outlier has truly been life-changing for me. I was previously working as an SDE at an MNC in a different city, away from my elderly parents. I came across Outlier and, like many others, I was initially skeptical due to the negative comments I had seen online. But I decided to explore it anyway and started tasking earlier this year.

To my surprise, I began earning a substantial income. As I continued, I realized how much I enjoyed the work and how closely the tasks aligned with my background in computer science. Eventually, I made the decision to pursue Outlier full-time, which was one of the best decisions of my life.

Honestly, I don’t understand the hate Outlier receives online.

"I found Outlier through a reddit thread and had no idea what it was at first. Once I passed the initial assessment in February, it took a few days for me to see a project come in. I was lucky to be a part of a voice project as my first experience on Outlier. I had so much fun recording and it was such a novel type of work for me. I was made a reviewer a week later and I'm even more grateful for that opportunity. 

I've been on most of the voice projects since and have truly loved working with fellow contributors, QMs, and admins who value critical thinking and collaboration. Each project is different, which is wonderful for my ADHD brain. Merit is one of the main drivers for success on the platform and that is personally very important to me. I've made about $15k in 15 weeks. Some weeks are better than others, and just like any contract work, there is no guarantee. I could have made more, if I had the bandwidth to put more hours in.

I just have a Bachelors in Organizational Leadership, and am a full time artist, and there are consistent opportunities for me, which I am grateful for. If you have STEM background, there are so many opportunities that many of my peers have access to, and I know they are adding even more areas like psychology, business, and law to name a few. 

This platform has truly been a saving grace for me after my mother passed away, as I needed to take a step back from my businesses, but wanted something flexible enough to do on my own schedule. She would love to know all those theatre rehearsals she drove me to are being put to good use with voice acting now. I love being able to apply many of my skills to contribute positively to the world of AI. One project I'm about to work on will be used to help improve an assistance app for the vision impaired. That is something so beautifully tangible that most ""jobs"" don't offer. 

Like any workplace there are some bad apples that can make ""going to work"" not so fun. When situations have happened, I feel fortunate that the people I escalated issues to took me seriously and supported me, just like any good leadership team should.

I think the platform has many areas of opportunity, as any pioneering company does in the first few years. 
1. Leadership staffing issues leads to a lot of communication hiccups. Staffing a 100 person project with 3 managers versus a 10k person project with only 2 probably isn't the best choice. There are many great contributors who could hold roles such as channel moderator to help assist QMs at least. 
Many of the reviewers already do this, but it often can creates issues, as power dynamic issues within digital spaces often do.
2. Hiring an Organizational Standards Manager (I'm available *wink wink*) to consult with project leadership. Clear SOPs with continuous updated communication seems to be a struggle on multiple projects. In my opinion, admins not keeping up-to-date spec docs is what most of the contributor headaches stem from. Due to the review process, it's single handedly the cause of useable data either being thrown out or poor quality data being passed through, both of which tremendously affect both Outlier's and Clients' bottom lines.
3. Utilize people with Instructional Design backgrounds to craft onboarding training. 
4. Clone Alex, the Community Manager :)

Overall, I really enjoy the work itself and most of the people I interact with. It's such a unique contract position that allows you to be as engaged as you'd like or just do your own thing.  

I know things will continue to improve and I'm excited to be along for the ride in a way that enables me to also pursue my other priorities. ",Great opportunity to be a part of shaping AI,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/684399a9209e838f990007b9

"I am writing a review after using Outlier for a little over a month
- It provides opportunities to work to anyone with a certain level of intellectual ability
- Compared to a company interview, you can become a member of the site after going through a relatively simple verification process
- After signing up, various tasks that match your intellectual ability are suggested to you individually, and if you successfully complete this course, you can proceed with the tasks from then on
- However, the work must maintain a certain level of quality or higher in order to continue working.
- The work rate varies by task
- I can explain that the work I did was creative writing and talking to others, these two things
- Since the income is exactly proportional to the amount of work you do, the income varies depending on your will
- The work is conducted according to relatively strict standards and procedures. However, there were times when I felt that the work procedures did not proceed smoothly (I guess it is the same everywhere where people work:))

"Was skeptical at the begining, as I read alot of negative reviews about Outlier.ai and had faced bit of trouble matching with the proper project. But once being matched with right project everything has been going well, almost perfect!

Definitely worth the time if matched with project that uses the expertise we have!

It is noteworthy that tasks and projects are not always available and there is bit of learning curve with projects. There are specific preliminary courses and assessment to be completed before you can actually start undertaking tasks and making money. While it is sometimes, time consuming and difficult to understand the requirements, it is worth the effort.

The only drawback I can see is that they appear to have less people handling the whole platform, therefore the communication is bit slower (may take a day or half a day to hear back from the team) when you require help, or it could be because of the difference in timezone. Regardless, I trust that the platform will definitely improve slowly in time with increase in the manpower they have. I highly recommend to try and apply effort than passing negative judgements.

All in all, in my opinion is Outlier.ai is great platform to use our scientific knowledge in AI training and get good return out of our time and efforts! Based on experience this is the best one out there!

As a returning student, while also caring for my young family, remote work with Outlier gave me the flexibility I needed. It allowed me to earn a steady income from home, which helped me save for school and continue providing for my family without compromising my responsibilities and school.

"I joined Outlier nearly a year ago, originally hoping to build a side gig that could help fund a few vacations or the occasional fancy dinner with my girlfriend. Fast forward a few months, and what began as a side hustle has turned into my full-time career—something I didn’t expect when I started.

That said, this isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes real effort. If you consistently deliver quality work, you'll see opportunities and growth. If not, you might struggle to earn more than a few dollars. There are slow stretches where projects are hard to come by, and other times when the workload feels endless.

The platform isn’t perfect. Some processes could definitely be more efficient, and the support team is often slower to respond than it should be—that's probably the biggest downside. It would also be great to have more say in which projects you take on. Still, I’m confident these issues are being addressed (or at least trying to be), as I’ve seen noticeable improvements across the platform since I first joined.

Despite those flaws, I now earn twice as much as I did in my previous (management) job—all from the comfort of my home, even after accounting for the occasional slow weeks.

"Great platform with solid earning potential

I've been working with Outlier for several months now and overall it's been a positive experience. The earning potential is definitely there if you're dedicated and produce quality work consistently. 

What I appreciate most is the variety of projects available - though I should mention that your experience can vary significantly depending on which project you're assigned to. Some projects are more engaging and better compensated than others, but that's to be expected with any platform like this.

The work itself is intellectually stimulating, particularly if you enjoy AI-related tasks. The platform is well-designed and generally user-friendly, though there's always room for improvement in communication and project clarity.

What really stands out to me is the platform's potential. You can see they're investing in growth and expanding their offerings. For anyone looking for flexible remote work with decent pay, this is definitely worth considering.

My advice: be patient during the onboarding process, focus on quality over speed initially, and don't get discouraged if your first project isn't perfect - the right project match can make all the difference.

It's not something to rely on as a full-time income, but if you're consistent, you can earn a solid amount monthly. Just make sure to handle taxes properly if your earnings grow.

"Entrei na plataforma no final de 2024 e é a mais desorganizada que já vi na vida. Você passa mais tempo fazendo curso e testes do que fazendo task; em raros casos consegue projetos; em outros, é alocado em projetos que estão desabilitados, próximos de acabar (esses nem deveriam ser oferecidos a novos CBs) ou que não são do seu interesse – tem um que já rejeitei várias vezes e continuam me alocando nele. 

De volta ao excesso de cursos e alocações aleatórias: não entendo a lógica da Outlier de achar que por sermos freelancer temos todo o tempo do mundo para fazer infinitos cursos (incluindo de projetos inativos) sem remuneração. 

Inclusive, estava indo bem em um projeto, de repente me jogaram para outros projetos que não tinham tasks. Desde então, estou nesse looping. Já pedi suporte, QMs tentam ajudar, mas não adianta. Insistem em me alocar quase todo dia em outros projetos, não consigo executar tasks nem ganhar dinheiro. 

A parte de revisão de tarefas tb é falha, se ocorre um equívoco, sua média cai e a nota não é corrigida no sistema. 

Isso sem considerar alguns cursos que são extremamente mal elaborados e testes que nem sempre condizem com o treinamento - seria bom haver profissionais qualificados para revisar esses conteúdos para cada país. Sei disso porque já fiz cursos e testes que foram bem-elaborados por lá e condiziam com o dia a dia das tasks.

And it really worked – in the sense that I had tasks, they were paid fairly, and I had my money in my PayPal account on time every Wednesday. The important thing is not to just wait for tasks to come in; you should also actively take care of them, establish contact with the QMs (the people responsible for the individual projects), and work regularly. Over time, the repertoire grows; various projects start, some end, and new ones come along. There are also lean periods, but you have to expect that; it's not your primary source of income, although you can easily earn four-figure sums per month (you should definitely inform the tax office...).

2) Assessment cannot be fully cleared based on what is explained in the instructions.

Using VPNs, proxies, or even Chrome add-ons is strictly prohibited, as the system can flag you for breach of conditions and even block your account. Even I accidentally had my VPN on once and had to re-do the identification process. So, it’s important to be aware of these potential issues.

However, it’s worth noting that there’s a learning curve. You need to be patient and willing to reach out to support when needed. But especially, actively check every single message on the Discord forum and discuss issues with the project managers. Many people complain about not getting tasks on a silver platter, but writing to project managers has almost always resolved my issues, including empty queues or lost work.

Working on Outlier requires a certain level of flexibility and quick adaptation. Projects are usually short-lived, and you may find yourself juggling multiple projects at once, which is contrary to the typical “workflow.”

But once you get the hang of things and don’t get bogged down, it’s absolutely terrific (not even up for discussion). In the four months I worked with Outlier, I was able to pay off my student debt loan, which was a significant financial burden, and now live my life with a lot less stress.
I don’t understand why people call it a scam. I never had a single unpaid work, and even when my projects got accidentally disconnected due to internet connection or glitch, I was able to get every single dollar I was owed by writing to support.

And no, the absurd ""compensations"" you see are exactly true; the payments are sometimes 2-3x the minimum wage depending on the country.

In summary, despite some areas that could be improved, journey with Outlier has been life-saving for me. ","Outlier, you either love it or hate it (I love it)",5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6821165b2249928899b76436

"I've been working at outlier for almost a year now, and have basically had a task except for a period of time at the end of the year at Christmas when I went through about 1 month of eq.
But what makes it strange is that I have also recommended my friends to join outlier, but none of them have stuck with it, I think it might be due to the following:
1. lack of patience: outlier requires very high quality, so if you lack the patience to learn how you can provide high quality content, you may not be able to pass the text. And even if you pass the text, you will not be able to carry out the tasks for a long time
2. accept the premise that the tasks is not stable: because the system assigns tasks is random (I know of this), there may be the case that you have studied and passed the text, but still eq. But if you study, it will definitely help you to do the subsequent questions.
3. Keep working hours: If you happen to be assigned to a project with tasks, keep working hours. Because the longer you work, the more chance to work, the more you show high quality and thus get more assignments. But if you only work less than 5h a week maybe you will suffer long eq. 
I think outlier is a good platform, although it is true that it has some problems. However it is truly provide a chance for me to work. And I feel really thankful.

"I've been working with Outlier AI for the past five months, and I’d like to share my genuine experience. Initially, I was skeptical due to some negative reviews online that made the platform seem like a scam. However, I can now confidently say that Outlier is legitimate.

The onboarding process is rigorous and highly selective, with a strict zero-tolerance policy for the use of large language models (LLMs). This makes joining quite challenging, but it also ensures high standards across the board.

There is a task allocation system in place that aims to distribute work fairly. However, based on conversations with other contributors, not everyone is fully satisfied with how tasks are assigned. The tasks themselves can be quite demanding, and the internal review checks may feel frustrating at first. That said, with a bit of experience and a few submissions, these checks become more manageable.

One of the strong points of Outlier is its reliable payment system. Payments are made every Tuesday, and if you've completed work, you will be paid accordingly. Additionally, there are various bonuses available to help motivate contributors.

My main criticism is that there’s no guarantee of consistent task availability, which can be disappointing for those looking for steady work.

"Ich habe 8 Monate bei Outlier gearbeitet. Hier meine Erfahrung: 
- Onboarding hat sehr lange gedauert
- Das Stundenhonorar ist zwar in Ordnung, jedoch muss man für jedes Projekt zunächst Trainings absolvieren, die nicht bezahlt werden. Und man hat keine Sicherheit, ob man in das Projekt reinkommt. Oft waren die Projekte bereits abgeschlossen, wenn ich mit dem Training und den Trainingstasks (die zu einem sehr niedrigen Stundensatz bezahlt werden), durch war. 
- Man verbringt wirklich sehr viel Zeit mit Training. 
- Zuallerletzt habe ich einfach keine Tasks mehr bekommen. Die Projektmanager konnten mir nicht weiterhelfen. Und als ich dann den Support kontaktiert habe, wurde ich einfach komplett rausgeschmissen. Als Begründung kam, dass ich gegen ihre Regeln verstoßen habe. Was genau ich falsch gemacht haben soll, wurde nicht erklärt. Es kommt eine E-Mail mit einer Liste von Verstößen, die zum Ausschluss führen. Ich kann zu 100 % sagen, dass ich davon nichts gemacht habe.

"Great opportunity! I've been working on Outlier for 6 months, and so far, despite the ups and downs, the experience has been fantastic. It's a project-based platform, which means that you work when a project that fits your skills is available. The projects depend on customer demands; therefore is not always guaranteed work. For specific skills like math and coding, I've had a better experience because (at the moment) you can work more consistently, while for more general skills like just language, you work less. There have been long periods (even months) in which there were no projects available for me, but I think that's just how the platform works, which is based on the customer's requests. It should be noted that the company ALWAYS PAYS. Each task has an expire time which is different from project to project and it could be 10 minutes or 2 hours, it depends on the project and each task has a time payed at full rate and the remaining time payed half rate (for example let's say that the pay rate is $30/hour, a task lasts 40 minutes then you could be payed 30$/hour for 25 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes paid 12.50$/hour, but every project is different and the rate and time change foreach project). You are well paid, you receive what you work for, and you always receive payment on time every week. Initially, you have to be patient, take a few courses, and understand well how the platform works, after which it's all downhill (just like any other job). So far, I have earned well (more than the average salary in my country), even taking into account the ups and downs, the monthly average has been great, so I can't complain. The algorithm that assigns contributors to projects should be improved and more flexible (in my opinion) but now they are trying to introduce a new feature called ""Marketplace"" where you can choose the available projects, to avoid long periods of inactivity, so if this feature is introduced properly, it would be a game-changer.

"I have been working for Outlier for more than six months now, and so far, I am really happy with my experience. I have had the opportunity to work on several projects, all of which have been quite interesting and enjoyable.

For each project, there is an onboarding phase that explains the guidelines and how to find relevant resources. During a project, we have frequent Zoom meetings for updates and QA sessions. The QMs are very helpful and responsive.

Regarding compensation, the pay is fair, and I have never had any issues with receiving payments.

It's important to understand the rules, of course. Cheating is strictly prohibited, and doing so will result in being banned from the project and eventually from the platform.",Great opportunity with fair pay rates,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681e0e2fe61c8bca0fd55eca
"I have been working with Outlier since 2024, and it is a perfect side gig! Instead of playing games and watching series after my primary work, I decided to work extra here. It has also been very fun to work on the projects. 

I did read some negative reviews before I started here, but I don't agree at all. I am super thankful with Outlier and have been able to pay off some debts. I am, therefore, forever thankful to Outlier. I worked many hours and I earned a lot!

"Overall, I am satisfied with Outlier. They have provided me with an opportunity to earn substantial extra money. The pay is generally good and quite fair, although it depends on the project's complexity and your proven skills. There are two significant problems with Outlier:
- The job is not guaranteed. If there are no projects matching your skills, you may find yourself with an empty queue for a long time. The best thing you can do in such a case is try to pass tests for more skills, which is not that simple.
- The projects become more complex over time, and quality control becomes stricter. It is far too easy to fall under the restrictions for unsatisfactory job quality or to lose access to the projects completely.

Additionally, a great perk of this job is that you gain access to the most advanced LLMs, which are typically quite smart and helpful in my day-to-day tasks. ","The earnings are real, but the job is difficult",4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681e039a2e1b274e5a8f2af8

"Lavoro come freelance per Outlier da ormai quasi due anni, l'azienda è sicuramente una fra le realtà più all'avanguardia nel campo dell'addestramento delle Intelligenze Artificiali per il grande pubblico. Lavorando per loro si accede nel tempo a una grande varietà di progetti che spaziano su diverse discipline, si tratta di un'opportunità unica per muovere i primi passi in un settore in forte espansione, con compensi superiori a tante altre realtà nel mercato.
Personalmente in 2 anni non ho mai saltato un pagamento, ci possono essere dei ritardi legati a particolari progetti, ma l'azienda è solitamente seria e puntuale nella gestione dei compensi.
Rispetto agli esordi, il pool di collaboratori si è allargato a dismisura negli ultimi mesi, e questo ha sicuramente portato una serie di problemi che l'azienda sta cercando di risolvere. Il lavoro viene e va, dato che l'azienda lavora a sua volta con altri clienti, ma l'opportunità di arrotondare una discreta entrata, e di formarsi su un settore in forte crescita, è concreta. Gli orari sono flessibili, si lavora da remoto (il che è super!) e la squadra italiana è generalmente preparata nel gestire la comunicazione e i vari progetti, sempre premesso che nei primi passi bisogna avere un po' di pazienza, dato che la mole di lavoro iniziale potrebbe essere minima in certi periodi.
In generale bisogna avere buone doti di elasticità e tanta voglia d'imparare, ma l'opportunità è concreta e mi sento di consigliarla a chi ha voglia di mettersi in gioco.",Grande opportunità per lavorare da remoto nel settore dell'addestramento IA,5,it,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681dfdbb3c1aa3880f3303ac

Outlier is very trustworthy, the organisation is excellent and payments are regular and precise. One gets what is promised. 
There is loads of work and some projects are really interesting. By taking the work seriously from the beignning (adhering stricty to guidelines), one has good chances of success. Good performers get more work. 

On the negative side, some QMs are very manipulative and manifest a preference for some contributors over others. Maybe the organisation should take care that people who are also friends in the outside world do not favour each other so openly.  
Also, depending on the country, the means of payment are restricted. For example, I only can use Paypal or AirTM, and both offer unfavourable exchange rates.

"After passing the initial interview, I wasn't assigned to any project for a while. However, I was later fortunate to be placed on a very good project, which allowed me to earn a decent income. So, this company is definitely not a scam—I did receive payments from them, and they were generally on time. That said, there are indeed some areas that could be improved. For example, the algorithm used for project assignment is quite opaque, so you have no idea what kind of project you’ll end up with. Additionally, some project management teams are not very friendly, and at times, the tasks can feel quite confusing.",Not a spam but some areas could be improved,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681dc82b728674bddd33fc20
"I've worked with this platform for a while now, mainly in RLHF/SFT prompt engineering tasks focused on Java coding, and I think a more realistic, balanced perspective is needed amid all the noise.

Yes — the onboarding tests are hard. Yes — the expectations are high. Yes — you are very replaceable. And no — you won’t be spoon-fed work or success. But if you're genuinely skilled, consistent, and take the time to understand the guidelines, there is meaningful and well-compensated work here.

Much of the negative feedback seems to come from people who didn’t pass the tests, didn’t read the documentation, or tried to game the system. I understand the frustration, but blaming the platform doesn’t change the fact that this is a professional environment with high standards.

In my own experience, the feedback has been fair, and scoring is consistent if you actually follow instructions and reflect on reviews. I’ve received high ratings on the majority of my completions and found the communication with queue managers and squad leads to be respectful and clear — especially compared to other freelancing platforms.

There are downsides, of course: task availability can fluctuate, and it's not always transparent how reviewer promotions or long-term access are handled. There's a lack of information, especially if you've failed a test. You might get removed from projects without prior warning. But that’s a risk with freelance work — high risk, high reward. No job security like a traditional employer offers.

"Outlier is a pretty good platform. I have done annotation tasks on multiple platforms and find it to be the best overall.
First, the rewards are very high. Depending on the type of employment and the type of task, I have been paid more overall than other platforms.
Second, the community is excellent. I can get advice from QMs in my language and regular meetings to improve the quality of my tasks.
Furthermore, the instruction is excellent. Not only are they shared in written files, but they are also clearly explained on the platform and sometimes work videos are shared.
However, there are some drawbacks. First, there is a certain amount of time when tasks are not assigned; if the Empty Queue period were shorter, it would be even more appreciated.
Also, there are times when work cannot be done due to platform errors. Most of the errors are resolved within a day, but there are occasional glitches that are slow or do not operate according to the manual.

"As a ""Tasker"", you will be applying your expertise to train AI models. ""Reviewers"", then assess the quality of work done by Taskers to ensure the project requirements are met. Each project stems from a ""Client"" that has specific goals, which makes the types of projects quite vast - in style, complexity and pay. I really like the challenge that Outlier AI presents to their contractors and the pay can be great (I earned up to $400 USD/hour!). 

Yet, contractors need to be very lucky to be assigned to such excellent project (as the Management can be great or very poor). More often than not, though, projects may not pay well (~$15 USD/hour), not be reviewed properly (by reviewers with little expertise) and may be kicked from projects (several poor reviewers by bad reviewers). Contractors need to be patient/determined (as there may not be work for 3-4 weeks) and lucky to be selected for great projects. 

I am, overall, very happy with my Outlier AI experience as I have earned ~$11K USD in 4 months, just doing part-time (evenings and weekends).

While I can’t yet choose my own projects, I’ve heard that this option is being developed, which is promising. Even without that, this job already feels remarkably close to ideal. Being able to work from home is something l value, and getting paid fairly and without delay makes the whole experience feel even more rewarding.

"Llevo casi un año en Outlier y mi experiencia es muy satisfactoria.

Si te gusta trabajar con el lenguaje y ver cómo van evolucionando los modelos de IA de forma práctica, el trabajo en sí es muy interesante. 

Al principio te puede costar un poco hacerte con la dinámica de la plataforma, pero una vez has entrado a un proyecto, los QMs (Quality Managers) te ayudan en todo lo que necesitas, igual que la gente que ya tiene experiencia, todo el mundo ayuda a todo el mundo, muy pocas veces das con alguien que no se muestre colaborador. En definitiva, el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, y hay reuniones, ""trainings"", ""onbordings"", ""war rooms"", etc. continuamente donde aprender, preguntar y resolver dudas.

Para recibir tareas, debes estudiarte las normas de cada proyecto a conciencia, pasar evaluaciones y trabajar de forma rigurosa, pues que tengas o no tareas depende de tu calidad, bueno, y de que haya, claro. Es importante tener eso en cuenta, el flujo de trabajo no es continuo, pero, de nuevo, mientras más calidad tengas, en más proyectos estarás y más posibilidades tendrás de que tu flujo sea lo más continuo posible. 

El pago es semanal, yo siempre lo recibo los miércoles por la mañana y nunca se ha retrasado ni he tenido ningún problema; sé que hay quién sí, porque enseguida se comentó en la Community, pero también sé que se lo solucionaron muy rápido.

En cuanto a proponer alguna mejora, se me ocurre que hay tareas cuya calidad aumentaría si se diera algo más de tiempo para completarlas, lo que redundaría en un beneficio para todos; y quizá que hay trainings y onboardings, sobre todo los largos, que estaría bien que se compensaran de algún modo.

En definitiva, según mi experiencia, Outlier es una empresa seria que no se dedica a estafar ni a robar a la gente, como he leído en algunos comentarios, que no entiendo qué pretenden aparte de asustar y evitar que la gente consiga trabajo.",Yo estoy contenta en Outlier,5,es,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681cd48d1d8ce79e0096a12b

That said, it’s still an amazing part-time job. If you're interested in training AI models, I highly recommend giving it a try—it has truly improved my life.

"I am a ""Trusted contributor"" according to Outlier, and writing this because I received an email from customer support asking me to go on here and confirm it is ""not a scam"". Here: NOT a scam. You WILL get paid, if you manage to task on it. It is a real US company based in California, they are not harvesting your data. I made nearly $%k on the platform in 1.5 months. Many made more. But that, unfortunately, is not the whole story. Outlier is still a malignancy that you probably do not want in your life if you have not already gone down the rabbit hole. I will not be a part of recruiting more British users to be romanced, emotionally abused and dumped by the roadside - basically what, to be a next best thing after it drove me to ruin and a financial and  mental crisis? Yes, I made that amount of money in a short period of time and when I needed it. But both the likelihood of that happening and the abrupt nature of it ending were akin to a lottery win, not work.  Outlier seems to be ignoring what happened for three weeks before and has been happening for two weeks after (now). How all these weeks of high earnings, 4/5 and 5/5 feedback, reviewer status across a number of projects etc., one day - EXACTLY the moment you started to rely on it by necessity, since you are making good money and it makes sense, so you are not working anywhere or on anything else - will translate into a blank screen for no reason at all. Your Dashboard, Marketplace and all these features will disappear, you will be given endless bot runarounds, force-onboarded (without pay) on various EQ projects, and humiliated by adolescents in ""support"". Outlier managers on social media keep telling us that ""only scammers from India"" (their words, not mine) complain, but I am a (former) lawyer from the UK and the US and a middle-aged woman, and many others similarly situated are in the same position. Outlier recently deactivated all contributors from California (without warning to them, of course) because someone there sued and it was told it was  in violation of of many California labour (and gig work) laws.  I am NOT in CA (I am British but in the US now, Florida) but I have two law degrees and an MBA and am not tasking, because Outlier has all their legal skill sets mixed up in terms of people not sorted by jurisdiction, and refuses to manually confirm my skills in business FOR A MONTH despite an MBA. There is no management, recourse, oversight, etc. I was denied ""business"" and ""management"" as confirmed skills despite sending them my US business school diploma and transcript, (hello Outlier! Opened support tickets are there!) meanwhile a guy in one of my projects was tasking as an ""expert"" in management - against his own will - ""presumably because he worked as a sales manager for a beverage company 25 years ago"" (he is now a lawyer). A machine decided to put him in management after scanning his CV. I personally was a doctor for a week once because they made an error,  but they won't put me into disciplines I actually have degrees for. THAT is Outlier in a nutshell. Do NOT assume that is you are a UK/US professional then you will be treated humanely or with any sort of reason. I made that mistake.  Outlier is a casino, there is no other way to describe it. You do not wager money, but you wager unpaid time and mental health, and any amount you made has to be split across the time you were  navigating bizarre flawed instructions and tests and fighting to make it or dealing with the consequences of being seemingly discarded. The management  principle in Outlier can be best conveyed by evoking the soda machine from the future in the movie Idiocracy (if you have not seen it, you should).  A guy with IQ of 100 wakes up 500 years later and is now the smartest person on the planet. He attempts to procure soda at a nearest vending machine, which turns out to have simultaneously made a determination that he is an unfit mother.  That is how Outlier is run, more or less. You might make money. But it will very quickly be both and addiction and a mental and financial (metaphorically) cancer on your life.

"I am writing this review purely as a tasker's point of view. I am aware of the noise out there about the company's alleged behaviour but never faced any of that thus far. 

I was approached via LinkedIn in December 2024 and since I was interested in the topic of and involved in projects based on LLMs at the time, I registered and started tasking surprisingly quickly. I speak several languages and got therefore involved in multilingual machine learning projects almost from the get go. Initial onboarding was remunerated, as are the tasks. Subsequent training webinars are not. Payments happen every Wednesday for me, and Outlier never ever missed or delayed any payment so far, never.

Support on the platform is surprisingly efficient and actually pleasant, be it from our TMs or other taskers as well. This is quite well organised (with improvements regularly being put in place), but much happens very quickly and one must keep an eye on the community platform (not the same as but connected to the tasking platform) every day. Webinars happen nearly daily for the 3 projects I am involved in.

The platform has become much more professional, and now attracts much more experienced taskers with quality being the most important factor relative to delivery right now.

A minus point is the unpredictable availability of tasks. You may be swamped with tasks one month, and then have none to work upon for 3 weeks in a row. Also, regular exams are the norm, and if one fails, one may not get access to tasks for a while.  

Overall, my experience so far has been good, and I would do it again. One learns A LOT, not just about how LLMs function, but about plenty of other topics, since topics (say ""life sciences"", or ""business"" or ""sports"" give context to the tasks at hand).

Remember, this is NOT a job, a tasker is a freelancer, therefore, one cannot expect being treated as an employee. Also, tasks come and go. If you are ok with that, you should give Outlier a try. I like it personally.

"tl;dr No tasks for you and your skills will be poorly evaluated.

Outlier seems an attractive option to earn some extra money. However, with just a couple of hours you realize that it is not what you expected.

I am a senior software engineer that wanted to learn about how to improve AI using prompts and, why not, earn an extra money.

After spending a couple of hours (not paid) doing screen tasks for checking my knowledge and for preparing to a project, I was kinda shocked that I was sent no task at all. (The tasks were time demanding and I remember that one of them you had to review two extremely huge and bad formatted prompts).

But what lead me to write this review is that, after seeing that I was matched with a mission (not a guarantee of having tasks), I took another screen about docker and git. ""That should be easy for me, since I work with those tools everyday at work through my IDE"". My surprise was that I failed the screen test. And that is because it is extremely poor designed. You have 50 seconds to read the question and answer. And the questions are related to the specific syntaxis of commands you don't usually use because you use aliases or shortcuts. You don't have time even for explain the process to solve it and show you really know how these tools work under the hood.

There are many training sessions for each project, before and during the span of the project timeline. There is also a community platform where we can reach out to managers and other workers to ask questions, attend training and seek clarification and help. Whenever I encountered an issue, I could easily reach out, either via the chat box or emailing my manager. The issues are always resolved within 2 days, usually sooner.

Outlier is protective of personal information and is serious about preventing any form of misuse of such information. In their training, there is a big emphasis on the protection of personal data. I have not come across any abuse of data since I started working here, so I'm glad they are very vigilant and protective of this matter. 
All in all, I'm have a great time working at Outlier and I pray that perhaps one day I might get to work there as a full-time employee!",Great time working with Outlier AI! ,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681c424a82f8267da9c74b76

"It's great to know that Outlier is doing many things well to make my work enjoyable and rewarding. 

Here are the things that I mostly like:
- The clear guidelines and instructions that help me to set up for success as a reviewer.
- The interesting, engaging nature of the tasking itself
- The payrate for an hour is actually good.

And here are the things that they should improve:
- Lack of communication from their side. However, some meetings are there, but they are less active in the community.
- Sometimes, they are not available when needed most.
- Whatever the issues I have will get resolved, but it takes them too much time to fix anything, which could be improved.

Improvements can be made if we carefully listen and understand the users' issues. I am very happy with the Outlier Team from the past month. Working as a reviewer on specific projects, guiding my squads to produce high-quality tasks, and communicating with other country people really boost my productivity and knowledge in many aspects.

I wasn't familiar with the Outlier when I joined and started working on the platform (2nd Feb. 2025). In such a short time, I made more than $5K, which would not have been possible if the outlier team didn't trust me. I produced high-quality tasks that matched their expectations and their customer needs. Since then, I have am very happy :)

"I used ""outlier"" for about five months. I started this job to earn income after leaving my job for personal reasons. Although I am Korean, I was familiar with reading and writing English, so I didn't have much difficulty working on it. Of course, I often get help from a dictionary or a translator.
The biggest advantage of this job is that worker can easily access it from home. And worker can earn a pretty big income;about 1000 usd per a week. It's also a good advantage to be able to withdraw this income on a regular every week. But at the beginning of the job, I didn't get that big of an income. Because obviously the total amount of work is limited, so if you don't match a project with enough workload, you can't work even if you have time. What's important here is the quality of the task. If someone spend more time and work more carefully, evaluation as a worker goes up. So you have more accessible work and more opportunities. From then on, your income can increase significantly.
I was able to secure a stable and high profit every week from about the third month of my work.",A project in which workers get paid the price as much as they are careful and meticulous,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681c3e0f6ddf6cf67f868b0c

This is a rapidly learning and improving platform, which has a good number of genuine and knowledgeable contributors from a wide range of knowledge domains. It is also a genuine professional platform that pays contributors for the time and tasks they completed based on project specific pay rates.

For example, project instructions provide clearer clarity, are easier to access; project leads communicate more effectively in the discussion forums to allow people to anticipate their project's next steps. The platform has also put in place necessary screening assessment to allow people with the right skillsets to join the right projects, disseminated surveys to understand contributors' upcoming availability for prioritised projects.

However, there is one point to note. Task availability depends not only on your competence but also on luck, for example, mere timing or something like that. I am lucky enough to earn that much.

Outlier seems to try to distribute tasks based on one's ability but it doesn't necessarily succeed in doing so yet, I think. There are some problems regarding this point. Unreasonable reviews, frequently revised rules, timing issues (customer demand) and so on.

What we can do is do our best by checking frequently  (not only instructions but also) Outlier Community for new rules, doing tasks carefully and waiting patiently when there is no task available.

"I genuinely enjoy working at Outlier. The flexibility it offers in terms of time management is a significant advantage compared to traditional jobs—it allows me to use my time more effectively and maintain a better work-life balance.

However, there are areas that need serious improvement. My main concerns are the project assessments, the inconsistent quality of reviewers, and the way feedback disputes are handled. The assessment process feels unbalanced: it's remarkably easy to be disqualified from a project, yet onboarding and task completion can be unnecessarily difficult and unclear. It's extremely frustrating to invest over 45 minutes thoroughly reviewing project guidelines, only to be rejected over two incorrect answers. That kind of rejection feels like a poor return on a significant time investment.

Even after passing assessments, the next challenge often lies with the reviewers. Unfortunately, many appear unqualified or inattentive. The review process can feel arbitrary, and the dispute system is slow and often unresponsive. Outlier has stated that not all disputes can be reviewed, which is deeply discouraging and unfair. Like in any job, mistakes can happen, and there will be a range of performance levels among workers. But those who are genuinely trying and willing to improve should be given second chances.

"I’ve worked with Outlier for several months and have been paid reliably, always on time. It’s not a scam. The platform can be intellectually meaningful and well-compensated if you’re invited to participate in higher-tier projects, which is my case, I was invited because of my expertise.

That said, the platform is invite-only. As I know, many people sign up and never receive tasks, or only get very low-paying, repetitive work. I understand why that creates distrust.

Also, recently, in my personal experience, pay was reduced without warning or clear justification. As someone who put in a lot of time and care, that felt discouraging.

So yes, it works. But it’s selective and opaque. You could try it, but be aware of that if you’re thinking of applying. It’s not dishonest—but it’s not that transparent (in task distribution, especially) either. Moreover, it does not guarantee that everyone could get a high pay.",Outlier is not a scam—but it may not be suitable for everyone.,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681bef1c0072b6409a00765d

"I had the opportunity to work with Outlier, and while there were definitely things to learn, the overall experience left a lot to be desired especially from an engineer’s perspective.

One of the biggest issues I saw was the lack of respect and support for the people actually doing the work. Despite delivering high-quality output under tight timelines and vague requirements, feedback often felt harsh and one sided, with little to no regard for context or the effort involved.

The bar for quality is set very high but without the communication or structure to realistically support it. In many cases, it felt less like building something creative and meaningful, and more like just grinding through tasks.

"Outlier is a company that actually pays its employees. While it may seem suspicious at first, once you pass the screening test and benchmark task, you can earn an hourly wage. However, this process is not easy, especially for beginners. I also experienced failure in the tests at first. The disappointment was significant because the reward for that time and effort was either nonexistent or minimal.

When I first encountered Outlier, I was attracted by the high hourly rate, but after failing the tests and tasks, I felt like there was no opportunity. I was disappointed because the compensation was low compared to the promised hourly rate. The frustration I initially felt was great, but I kept challenging myself, and after 3-4 months of repeated attempts, I was able to achieve high performance in actual projects. (Though I did have some income after about a month, it wasn't until 3-4 months later that I started earning more than my previous monthly salary. Of course, I can't guarantee the sustainability of this income.)

Advantages:

1. Actual paying company: Outlier is a real company that pays its workers, so you can be sure it's not a scam.

2. Opportunities even after failing the test: Even if you fail the test, you’ll still be given opportunities to try other projects.

3. Compensation: You can earn good rewards through Reward missions. Since the compensation is performance-based, the more consistently you work and the better your results, the higher your reward.

Disadvantages:

1. Relatively difficult tasks: Outlier’s tasks are not just repetitive; they require creativity, analytical skills, and judgment. This is why the hourly rate is high. (I’m not sure if this applies to all projects, but at least the one I worked on was like this.)

2. Waiting time after failure: After being rejected from a project, it may take up to a month to get another opportunity. (This was my personal experience.)

3. Repetition of manuals and materials: You need to carefully review the manuals, and if you don’t understand something, you should ask the QM. It’s important to read them 2-3 times.

Conclusion: If you’re interested in AI-related work, Outlier is definitely worth considering. Once you overcome repeated failures, you can earn high compensation, and if your performance is good, there are plenty of opportunities for additional rewards.",Outlier Review: Advantages and Disadvantages,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681bec8a637119cc4de70e5a

Outlier provided me the platform to make good use my expertise and drag myself out of the financial rut. The financial struggles meant I was very serious with all my tasks right from the very beginning, and it did not take long for me to realize this a platform that rewards honest fully-committed quality work. It also offers me great flexibility, proven by the fact I am on my way to complete a 3 month unpaid internship. The internship takes up most of my normal working hours on weekdays. In spite of that, I have had absolutely no problem in meeting my financial demands, and still be able to save some money. 

On the other hand, the work itself is highly enjoyable. The generalist tasks have allowed me to gain valuable knowledge around Australian culture (me being a Bangladesh native looking to build a career in Australia). Once I started gaining access to specialist Mathematics and Physics streams, the level of enjoyment only got better. It was almost as if I could let my not-so-unsmart mind explore different areas of physics, which I had to perhaps let go owing to my specialization in Electrical Engineering, such as Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, Nuclear Physics, and so on. The Mathematics projects allowed me to use my creativity to manipulate mathematical problems and perhaps create completely new problems to try and make AI fail. It almost feels like sport at times with the Physics and Math Projects, where I am trying my hardest to make AI fail. In almost all projects, the training provided is highly detailed, often times with videos to help. 

Last but not least, the personal satisfaction I get from making AI fail is quite heavenly. At times I even feel like John Connor (haha), and it is all because of outlier. I would highly recommend anyone with intermediate level grasp of English and with good grasp of  physics and maths to give outlier a go.

"I’ve made a fortune working with Outlier, and I’m still making some extra cash. It’s a fantastic company that truly offers something for everyone, whether you're looking for flexible part-time tasks or more full-on, consistent work. Whether you prefer repetitive assignments or enjoy dynamic, ever-changing challenges, Outlier has options to suit your preferences.

From my experience, I’ve always been paid for the tasks I’ve submitted, and I occasionally receive missions that offer extra earning opportunities. One of the standout features is the supportive community of experts available to consult with on any project you're working on. They're always helpful and encouraging.

That said, there are a few areas that could be improved. At times, you may run out of available tasks, and there can be abrupt transitions to new projects. This can be frustrating if you've already invested time studying the guidelines of a previous project, only to have to start from scratch with a new one. Additionally, some tasks have expiration timers and can expire before you're able to complete them, which means you won’t be compensated for your effort on those tasks.

Overall, Outlier is a reliable and rewarding platform with a strong community and a wide range of opportunities. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to earn income on their own terms.",Reliable and Rewarding,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681bde95a9da43c8c6565cc1

Die Bezahlung passt aus meiner Sicht jedenfalls auch. Es wird exakt abgerechnet und jede Woche auf den Cent genau ausbezahlt. Zum Basis-Stundensatz gibt es noch zusätzliche ""Missions"" mit denen man bei Zielerreichung noch Zusatzeinkommen lukrieren kann.
Und für mich das wichtigste: ich kann selbst entscheiden wann und wie viel ich arbeiten will.

"The thing I like is that the platform values high quality workers with priority to future projects, better support .. etc. However, there're things that make the experience not the best it could be:
1- The fairness of the pay is questionable: let's be honest, we most importantly do such work for money and providing high quality work should be valued, yet what I noticed is that the pay rate isn't fair, I find people from the same country where I live working on the same project i'm on with the same skills and even less and less quality getting higher pay rate which makes me beleive that the pay rate is somehow assigned randomly.
2- The onboarding experience for a new project is just too bad and needs to be enhanced.
3- Reviews that are done from the QC need to be visible, I mean I'm currently an oracle, I do see in the dashboard that I get a score of 4 and 3, I need to know what is wrong with the task that I got 3 on so that I learn from that and get better (that's a very simple logic, I don't know what's the idea behind hiding the details for these reviews).",Outlier isn't a scam yet it's a bit unfair.,3,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681bdcaa4c622291f2790439

first thing, Outlier team reached me through Linkedin last February to offer joining the platform and that many people win 7$ in the first week, and I confirm that I won my first 7$ in the first 4 days in the project, after that I quit working in my full time .Net developer on a prestige company in Europe work to focus on working on Outlier platform.

most people who said that Outlier is a scam platform or that there is no way that you can earn real money through it either they don't know the platform well, or they made a huge error and broke the official rules of the platform so the platform banned them from working on it.

in April I earned 5100$ through working in outlier, and in the first week of April I earned 1850$ for only 7 days of work. SO GUYS THE MONEY IS REAL AND I GURANTEE THIS PLATFORM TO ALL OF YOU.

"Outlier is a platform that allowed me to work from home in the AI domain. I was a beginner in this field and did not know anything about the job, but they taught me how to work, and even when I made some poor submissions because I did not understand the instructions well, they paid me for them. They paid me every week with at most one day of delay. Because of this, after 6 months of work, I think Outlier is a great opportunity.

One point that could be improved is the consistency of available tasks; I still need more options to ensure a regular income.

Another point is support: like every company today, it’s difficult to reach a real person to resolve any issue.

Also, reviewers and contributors are not always aligned with the guidelines, and it can be frustrating when you are sure you did good work yet receive a bad review without understanding why.

The War Room is a good idea in theory: it’s a meeting where everyone on the project can come and ask anything to the QMs or the contributors. But the War Room usually causes confusion because someone can give wrong information, and even when the QMs are present, there are too many participants.

I would definitely recommend Outlier to anyone, but like in any job, you should be patient and take it seriously.

"I've been working with Outlier for a while now, and I am super happy. After several tries, I finally found a freelance job that literally works. The projects are super interesting and diverse, and the variety keeps things exciting and fresh. One of the standout aspects is the support: the team leads are responsive, helpful, and really make you feel valued. Due to the rotating nature of the projects, there can occasionally be short waiting periods between assignments, but that’s completely normal in freelance work. Very important: payments have always been punctual and reliable – every single week, without exception.

"Outlier is an excellent platform. What people mistake as a scam is just purely them not getting onto any projects. They see the test projects that pay little money per hour and assume the worst, but all they are  is a test.  The real projects that come up can pay very good money enough that this month I bought a boatload of shit I didn't even need. But outlier gave me that luxury and for that I am grateful. The platform goes through stages of lots of work and not lots of work, so sometimes patience is required. I think everyone should at least give them a proper attempt. It may take a while to get on a project, but once on, as long as you do the work, you will be well paid.

"Contrary to what you may find, Outlier is legit and actually pays. Its interface is pretty good (better than another platform I'm on) and the projects I've been able to do range from 'ok' to 'amazing'. The one issue I have with Outlier is that it's not very transparent on why you are taken off of projects even though you seemed to be doing a good job or why you do/do not get to work on certain projects. 
Sometimes this is just a matter of EQ because no more work is available, but sometimes the powers that be decided that you're not good enough or whatever and poof the project is gone. They have very helpful admins (QMs), though, so in most cases so far they could help out. It's just that Outlier as a platform sometimes moves in mysterious ways which prevents them from getting the 5th star.","Outlier, flawed but actually pretty cool",4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/681bcf2ea37880218ef0cded

One thing that really stands out is the support system. From day one, I was added to a squad with a knowledgeable lead and a community of other contributors who are always ready to help if I have questions or run into issues. It’s a genuinely collaborative environment, and I never feel like I’m on my own.
Outlier is also at the forefront of AI training. The projects are interesting and impactful, and it’s exciting to know that my work is helping to push the boundaries of what AI can do. The onboarding process was straightforward, and I felt supported every step of the way.
Most importantly, the earning potential has been fantastic. In just one month, I’ve made more than I expected, and payments have been very reliable so far ( Weekly payments).

"When I got the first e-mail in LinkedIn from some Outlier.ai recruiter I thought it was another useless advertisement trying to sell you something. 
But my curiosity took over and I gave it a try. I had to fill in my personal details and talk about a random subject to showcase my still in my native language (Dutch). After a week of working at like 30$/hour it was time for payday. Each week they send your money to your paypal account. I checked my account multiple times because I still didn't trust it completely. My money arrived just as promised and I started working like 30 hours plus each week. 
Now 5 months later I am involved in multiple language projects. Training AI models.
What I like most about Outlier.ai?
I can work whenever I want, late in the evening or early in the morning. When a project is done I automatically receive other projects when available. 
Also if you show high quality you can move up the ladder from contributor, reviewer, quality control to.... Quality is appreciated and you can earn bonuses regularly depending on the project you are in.

If you have problems most of the time the support quickly replies. Also working abroad is possible when you get an approved travel request (VPN not allowed). 

From the 5 months of working at Outlier.ai I only had 2 weeks with little work.
My overall experience is very good with Outlier and I would definitely recommend it to anyone not afraid of not having a fixed 9-5 contract.

A. Doing things that, honestly, if they fully understood, I doubt I’d still have an account. It's not something that's replicable anymore anyway.

B. Writing very convoluted math prompts in geometry  that makes it hard for AI models to visualize and answer correctly. For context, this gig was advertised as needing only high school level math, but in reality, you need a lot more than that to stump the model in any other field.

Anyway, the project I was working on got cancelled. After that, I got stuck with a physics model that feels like it has a PhD in everything, so now I can't produce any tasks to earn money.

Realistically, I don't see any way to earn good money from this long-term. To make anything decent, you pretty much have to finesse the system. I still have an account with them, so maybe I'll post an update later if anything changes.

"The work is pretty good, when there is work. But as a worker you are completely disposable, and there is no attempt by the company to try to keep you around. There are some major flaws with the way the site operates, and they never attempt to fix them. The site is not a scam, but it is just highly-volatile gig-work. Set your expectations low, and use at your own risk.

The most glaring issue is the reviewer-attempter system in tasks. Attempters write a prompt, stump the model, either edit/rewrite then summarize the reasons the model failed. It is the most time consuming, difficult and value-adding aspect of the process. 
Those tasks are passed to reviewers, who assess the task, verifying that the task was done according to the project guidelines, and assigning a rating to the attempted. The issue, is that reviewers are given the option to mark the task, write what's wrong with it, and fix it, or to reject it outright. If they decide to fix it, they need to verify every step, ensure the model was incorrect in the way the attempted mentioned, fix every reasoning and formatting issue, and grade it, to which they will be graded on their assessment and the correctness of their edits. 
The other option is to just reject the prompt and move on, with no scrutiny and no risk to your own rating. So because there is no positive incentive to edit, and provide a good rating to the attempters, this system is completely abused by reviewers, and the cost is paid for by the attempters. 

If an attempter is given enough low-ratings they get removed from the project, with no recourse or a way to defend themselves.
This happens on every single project I've worked on, and it is constantly talked about on the forums, yet nothing has ever been done about it.

This is not a criticism of the people doing the reviews, but this is just the natural outcome of the perverse incentive structure they have set up.

I've done both roles, and without question attempting is so much more difficult. The first project I started on, was as a reviewer, which should tell you a lot about why reviews are they way they are. This happens so frequently that when starting a new project, it is fully expected that this is how projects work, you are allowed to work until one day you randomly get kicked off.

The purpose of reviews are to prevent spam, AI-generated material, and general low quality submissions, which there certainly is a lot of. But this is also a problem at the reviewer level as well, as I've seen many instances of feedback that was clearly written by AI chat models.

Not only does this system negatively affect the people who are providing their labour, but it also reduces the number of tasks that get sent back to the client. Since legitimately good tasks are being rejected because of the negative incentive of their review system. As well, in the long term, no one is going to stick around on this gig-work for very long.

Besides the most obvious issue, there are many others. Starting out, I had to repeatedly do training courses that barely amounted to anything. Each project has a training course, that takes anywhere from 30 minutes to over 2 hours, to complete, unpaid. Often these courses had a quiz or a skill test afterwards. The quizzes often had incorrect answers, or poorly worded questions that had multiple correct answers. If you don't guess correctly, you're off the project. 

There is a bonus system for completing a certain number of tasks in a given time, but these are mostly impractical, and often even impossible to accomplish. i.e. complete 6 tasks in the next 12 hours, when each task takes 3 hours or more, and the clock started at 3 in the morning.

It's a real shame that this company operates in this way. The value that Outlier is getting from purchasing peoples labour, comes from them creating unique and original data sets, which can not be found elsewhere. The work is difficult, and highly specialized, so one would think that it would be mutually beneficial to keep people onboard. The QM's that communicate with taskers on the forums are clearly working very hard to accommodate, and listen to the very real concerns, but at the end of the day no one with the ability to implement structural changes is actually listening and nothing actually changes.","It could be great, but in reality it is just unreliable gig-work.",2,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6807d9b39e6a43a1af413cb9

"I can confirm that Outlier is not a “data‑stealing scam.” Over the past few months I earned a bit over $2,700, and every payment hit my bank account on schedule.

After meeting all published guidelines, I received a single, passive‑aggressive banner (“you did not meet the quality threshold… support cannot speed up this process”) and was summarily dropped from the project—no rubric, no examples, no chance to correct. When I asked for specifics, I was met with canned responses that did nothing to explain what changed overnight.

If you’re considering Outlier, know that you will be paid for completed tasks, but you may also be removed at any moment with zero actionable feedback. For those of us who rely on this income to cover essentials like rent, that opacity is more than inconvenient—it’s destabilizing.

"I’ve been working on Outlier since late 2024 and can confidently say it’s a legitimate platform that pays consistently. I’ve received weekly payments without fail for the work I’ve done — not once has there been an issue.

That said, it wasn’t a walk in the park initially. When I first signed up, I had to understand how to complete tasks across various projects. Each project comes with its own set of detailed instructions, tests, and often a high-quality benchmark. I failed quite a few—at least a dozen—before I found a few projects that clicked for me. Since December 2024, I’ve been able to work daily and earn steadily.

The pay is good, and I appreciate the flexibility to work from home, mainly because I have kids. It allows me to balance work and family life in a way that a traditional job just wouldn’t.
I’ve seen people online claiming Outlier is a scam or data-harvesting scheme. Honestly, I don’t get it. My experience has been the exact opposite. So far, I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with the platform and team: great interactions with their tech support and project supervisors—they’re responsive, professional, and genuinely helpful.

I’m glad I didn’t go online to check if they were a scam at the start — otherwise, I probably would’ve been dissuaded and missed out on this great opportunity. Thankfully, I wasn’t aware of any negative information. I hadn’t even heard about Outlier before, and when I joined, their terms and conditions were crystal clear: there’s no guarantee of regular work — it’s based on what’s available. That helped me set realistic expectations from the beginning.

AI tasks demand a high level of precision, so treat your tests, quizzes, and assessments with the same seriousness you would approach your college exams. 

Do not rush to submit tasks unless you are confident that they are perfect. If you violate the specific project guidelines multiple times, you risk being removed from the project, as the standards for your tasks must be very high to be effective. Many negative reviews arise because individuals are frequently removed from projects for failing to meet the strict guidelines necessary for AI training. 

It's important to understand that being a great scientist or a highly intelligent person does not automatically make someone an effective AI trainer.

"I’ve made over $10K on this platform in a short span, but it came at the cost of over 300 hours of intense work. Still, the experience has been nothing short of frustrating.

I was fully committed to the ""Purple_wizards"" project, even brought into the SuperAttempters group. After putting in 150+ hours, I was suddenly removed without any warning, explanation, or communication—disconnected from the Discourse channels and ghosted by the QMs I had been actively working with. No heads-up, no courtesy. Just gone.

Instead, I was force-assigned to ""Mighty Moo,"" a project I had zero interest in. After everything I invested into one project, shouldn't it be my choice whether to switch? I raised a request via the help center—only to get useless, bot-generated responses. No real support, no accountability.

Days went by with no answers. I even had to track down people on Reddit just to figure out what happened—because the so-called “committee” doesn’t communicate. QMs? They don’t even pretend to care.

Then, one random morning, I couldn’t log in—my account was deactivated. Why? Because I didn’t jump onto a project I never asked for.

Thanks, Outlier, for proving that money isn't everything—especially when respect, transparency, and basic communication are completely missing.

There’s a lot of misinformation out there, but based on my personal experience, Outlier has been professional and consistent. Communication is clear, and I’ve never had any issues with payments or data privacy.

"I quit my job last year and I started to stress out when my savings were about to be finished. A friend introduced me to Outlier in December and I’ve personally had a very positive experience. I’ve been fortunate enough to receive a consistent amount of work while being paid weekly through PayPal. 

The work depends on your expertise and whether you do well in the pre-assessments which gauge your comprehension in certain areas.

It isn’t perfect and there are some weeks where I don’t have much work - but that’s to be expected from a platform like Outlier where the work availability depends on their customers. The extra income is always appreciated personally. 

I’ve tried other platforms that allegedly pay you for AI annotation work, but I never had any luck with them either due to a difficult application process or just never hearing back. I find Outlier to be very accessible to a lot of people as they have a broad range of expertise needed in their Opportunities page, so I think there’s something for everyone. 

There are a lot of posts online about people being “falsely” deactivated or alleging that Outlier is a fake platform, but this is totally not true and I personally believe these people broke the rules as laid out in Outlier’s T&Cs and are sour about it. As long as you follow the rules and do the work honestly, you’ll have a positive experience on the platform.

Most remarkably, it rekindled my long lost passion for teaching mathematics. Training AI models through your platform reminded me why I fell in love with education in the first place. It was always so satisfying to log in and task almost everyday. They never miss a pay day(I always looked forward to waking up to alert on Wednesday), missions also made the pay more rewarding.

That's why it hurt deeply when my account was deactivated over untrue claims without giving any opportunity to defend my work or demonstrate my integrity. 

I worked tirelessly, reached senior reviewer level on some projects, and took pride in being a trusted contributor (Oracle member). To be removed so quietly felt as though none of that dedication mattered.

One thing to note is that the time spent learning the instructions or completing onboarding is not considered paid work, so you'll need to go through that part on your own time. However, once you're onboarded and consistently submit high-quality work, the projects tend to last for a while, giving you the flexibility to work whenever you want and earn as much as you put in.

"I worked with Outlier for about a year as an attempter and senior reviewer in many projects, and overall, there were both positives and negatives during my time with the company.

On the positive side, Outlier is a trustworthy platform when it comes to payments. They were always on time with earnings — I never experienced any delays, which gave a strong sense of reliability. The flexibility of working from home was also a great benefit and made it easier to manage my own schedule.

However, one of the main downsides was the communication. When issues arise, it's extremely difficult to get personalized help. Most responses come in the form of automated messages, and it's rare to get through to an actual person who can assist meaningfully. This becomes especially frustrating when you encounter a serious issue.

Recently, my account was held, which I believe was unfair. I had followed all the guidelines and steps as instructed, yet I was told the decision was final with no room for further discussion. After that, all my communication channels with the company were shut down, and I’ve been unable to contact anyone to understand what happened or get clarification.
I strongly believe that the lack of communication and meaningful support is a major weakness that could seriously affect Outlier in the long run. When contributors are met with automated responses, no clear path to escalate issues, and no opportunity to defend themselves, it creates frustration and a sense of being undervalued. This not only discourages long-term commitment, but also risks pushing away skilled and dedicated individuals who want to contribute meaningfully. Over time, this can damage the company’s reliability and reputation.

"I have always worked in academia and very often you face burnout when you understand that not everything you do humanity will actually be able to use. Fundamental science produces a lot of new knowledge and helps us better understand the world around us, but behind all this there are people who daily face failures and refutation of their own hypotheses by experiment.
I received an invitation to participate in Outlier after winning a prize in ""Humanity's Last Exam"".
Participation in Outlier showed me that my unique knowledge in my field will not remain useless, that thanks to my daily work I know a little more than many and have enough expertise to discuss quite complex issues. This motivated me a lot. I wrote questions to which AI models gave some answers and I looked at how far these models were from the real understanding of things. With each new question I noticed that the answers became more accurate and the reasoning deeper. I have seen my actions improve the product right now - this is something that many researchers lack. Many of us will not see the practical results of our work in our lifetime. 
Different people are invited to Outlier and some try to earn more by dishonest ways. Such people are everywhere, but I really liked that the system reacted very quickly and additional mechanisms for assessing the honesty of participants appeared. We all discussed together how we could improve the system and many things that we suggested as participants were introduced. This made me especially happy - your voice can really change and improve something.
Sometimes there were technical problems and delays with payments, but they were in touch with us and tried to solve such problems especially quickly.
In addition to technical problems, I also noticed some inequality between participants from different countries. Not every country will allow you to participate in the project. Some of my colleagues and friends to whom I gave referral links said that the platform does not allow them to work in their country of residence.
I understand why this happens: for the company, the participation of some citizens is a big risk. The company can lose more than gain from such cooperation, but it still upset me. Because behind the money and risks there are competent people who have unique knowledge in their field and are ready to help improve the product with their expertise.

The last thing I wanted to write about for those who are thinking about participating. In addition to the feeling of being involved in something useful and important, I made quite a lot of money by my standards. In a month of working 10-15 hours a week, I earned $6,000.

"I've been working in the Outlier platform since 2024. It is a great freelance/part-time platform with real tasks and pays on time. The availability of tasks, in my experience, depends on how well you perform with the previous ones, which is, of course, natural that you have to prove your skillsets in order to be entrusted with other, especially, high-valued tasks. The support is great, whether it be for technical issues or project-specification ones.",Review for Outlier,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ff4497434fcf2ad9a052de
"As a college student, I often found myself financially dependent on my parents, which left me feeling uncomfortable. One day, while scrolling through Instagram, I came across Outlier. Initially, I was skeptical — like many others, I came across mixed reviews, with some claiming they hadn’t been paid. Despite the doubts, I decided to give it a try.

I went through the verification process, passed the assessment, and received my first project. Still unsure of the platform’s legitimacy, I completed just one task for a small amount to test whether I’d actually be paid. To my surprise, I received the payment promptly. I had to link my payment account by providing the associated email. Initially, I entered the wrong email, and the system restricted changes to payment methods to once per month. Concerned I’d have to wait weeks to receive my payment, I reached out to the support team. They responded within a few hours and allowed me to update my payment details immediately. This was just one of many instances where Outlier's support team provided prompt and helpful assistance.

Encouraged by the positive experience, I completed more tasks the following week with a higher payout — and once again, I was paid on time. That’s when I truly realized that Outlier is legitimate and reliable.

For the first five weeks (up to the end of March), everything went smoothly, and I consistently received tasks. However, starting in April, task availability has dropped significantly. In several projects I joined, I was removed for reasons beyond my control, such as:

1. The domain I was assigned to was no longer available.

2. There were no tasks left to distribute.

3. The project was temporarily paused.

Out of around 10 projects I’ve participated in, I was removed from two due to my own mistakes, and the rest due to project-related changes.

Overall, Outlier has been a great platform, especially for students looking to earn while learning. It offers genuine opportunities and reliable payments. With some improvements in community engagement — such as better communication with Quality Managers (QMs) and access to more stable projects — the platform could become even better.",My Experience with Outlier: A Game-Changer for Students,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ff43a3295064a42a03161c

It's worth noting that persistence is helpful. Project availability can fluctuate, with busy periods followed by quieter times. Finding a long-term project might involve going through several onboarding processes, so patience is beneficial, but I've found it pays off.

"After having worked on the platform for over a year, the following are my takeaways:

Pros: 
1. The pay is much better than any other work I could find online, giving me total control over my schedule. 
2. All the payments have been made on time(weekly) and it has proven to be very reliable. 
3. The diversity of projects keeps the work interesting.
4. As one of the avid users of the latest available models online, I really appreciate the opportunity to help make them better.

Cons: 
1. Sometimes the availability of the projects can be an issue and one might be left without tasks for days and weeks. 
2. There are random issues with the pipeline and at times the onboarding for certain projects can be tricky and frustrating. 


Summary:
The platform is a really great opportunity for folks like me to earn money on their own time. Of course, some issues need to be addressed with transparency and policies but I believe the people are trying their best to support and retain the talent.
Additionally, as they mention in their contract, I think of it as consultation/contractual work that may or may not exist for long and therefore I don't categorize it as a job but rather a low-hanging extra stream of income.

"Outlier Experience:
I've been doing online work with Outlier since October 2024, and continue to do so now in April 2025. The work has been really interesting, with a lot of variety. Basically, my work with Outlier has focused on LLM training: the tasks are to create questions that challenge a large language model to solve it with an appropriate response, that is usually quite detailed and complex. You type in a question (like, solve this system of equations) and the LLM tries to answer it, and then you guide the model to finding a correct answer. Given my expertise, I've been focused on creating mathematical challenges that are at the level of high school to graduate level university mathematics. 
   The pay for me has been quite good, for my level of experience and expertise (30 years of university research and teaching) merits a pay schedule at a higher rate. Other levels of expertise will rate different pay rates. Payment is based on number of hours worked and number of tasks completed, with bonus payments available when a large number of high quality tasks are successfully completed. There is a website to monitor how much money you make each day, and payments are sent out once a week. The website also invites you to other projects to try out, on different topics and different levels of difficulty. 
   The work is very flexible: you do your tasks online when you have free time. One constraint is that certain tasks have tight deadlines -- for instance you might have just 3 hours to complete a task, and if you don't complete it, you don't get paid. So you do need to plan your work schedule around this need for a block of time of a couple of hours per task to focus. Your work is also reviewed by other human participants (not the computer) so it is important to do good work in order to stay engaged, and paid, within the platform. 
   Technically, the online platform is pretty solid, with an uptime I estimate at better than 95%. When there is a glitch, there is online help to straighten things out quickly. It is also kind of fun to see how the computer/LLM tries to solve problems -- it's like seeing into the mind of the AI. Which makes the job fun!
   The Outlier site does request some personal information, as any employer might. When I was first filling out the information, I was a bit worried about ""what if this is a scam?"" But in the end, the information they take is pretty limited and they do not have my personal banking information, as you can collect your funds through online resources like Paypal and so on. 
   I also had a friend using Outlier (she is a language expert) and she had been successfully paid, which was reassuring to hear. So I went ahead with registering with Outlier. No regrets. 
   It is an online community of people working on these projects. We have webinars to discuss the project, help channels, online tech support. It's very professional. ",Outlier Experience:,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ff30c57958e30bd41b9014

"Outlier is NOT a scam.

Payout is weekly, and if you complete tasks on a given week, you will get paid.

Outlier has a lot of issues, and if you chose to work for them, you can expect some disappointment, because communication is very bad, and the platform is powered by AI and is prone to mistakes. 

Here a some I experienced:

1. I have been removed from projects without feedback, despite putting in honest work, and there is no one to talk to. Instructions are often not clear.


2. The displayed pay rate of the project is NOT the actual pay. 
You spend unpaid time on: significant onboarding; keeping up-to-date with the many many project updates everyday before starting actual work; joining compulsory meetings that could be at 3am because of time difference. This extra time is not a guarantee that tasks will be available.

3. You might go through the entire onboarding process, complete a couple tasks, and be transferred to another project without being asked, and you will need to complete the onboarding of that project.

4. What frustrates me the most is that if project guidelines change, and you are more up-to-date than the person who is reviewing your task, you will get a bad review, and possibly be removed from the project.

5. In all projects I have been involved so far, I had to design a prompt that makes the model fail within a given time (eg 1 hour). If the model doesn't fail, you do not get paid, regardless of how long you spent on the task.","Outlier is NOT a scam, but it does have a lot of flaws",2,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ff1af1d863f9875b1780c4

2. Excessive training and learning without being paid. (It may take from hours to weeks depending on the project guidance and the contributor's ability.)
3. Job insecurity: One may get removed from the project at any time depending on the project's availability and their quality of work.
Other tips:
1. Do not try to live on Outlier, as you do not secure any job on this platform.
2. Outlier will request your personal information to verify your identity. Please read the terms and conditions before providing your details.

"Outlier is a good platform for someone who is interested in AI. There are 2 types of tests: the platform skillset tests and project on-board tests. Platform tests are not difficult in general if you have related experience. The project test can be tricky sometime. My suggestions will be:
1.Try to pass more skill tests. Then you can have more project opportunities.
2.Try to pass more project on-board tests. Although not all on-board leads to real work, keep trying.
3.Keep good quality record during tasking. Good quality record can give you more opportunities.
4.Don’t do tasks out of your capabilities, and don’t use other AI during tasking.
5.Sometimes you need to wait for a suitable project.

"I am a freelance worker in Taiwan. I came across the job opportunity at Outlier by chance in January 2025. I did some research online and saw information that Outlier was cooperating with many well-known companies and some people were getting paid handsomely for working there part-time. However, I also saw people warning that this was a scam.

However, it was the Lunar New Year holiday in Taiwan at that time, and I was already in vacation mode, so I submitted my application with the mentality that it would not hurt to give it a try. After going through the on-the-job training course, I started my mission at outlier. Because this job is challenging in itself and it inspires my spirit of not giving up, I work very hard to complete my tasks, which also earns me more than $3,600.

At the suggestion and invitation of outlier, I would like to come here and share my practical experience with you.

They are certainly not scam. You get paid every Tuesday and whatever you earn is what you get paid. 

I think the true review would come from your experience of the company and the tasks.

"I've been on Outlier since October 2024. As a platform for freelance work related to AI training in a general/specialized field, Outlier offers a wide variety of projects at competitive and rewarding rates. From my personal experience, I've been fortunate to participate in many unique and intellectually stimulating projects with minimum downtime (i.e. EQ). The platform is continuously evolving and updating its processes, improving the Contributor experience. Overall, I appreciate the opportunity and can truly say that it is a great gig to work and earn!",A fantastic opportunity..,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fee68e1b7d6ce40e2573f0
"I have been working with Outlier for about 2 months now and in that period have made over $10,000. This is definitely a legitimate organization and a legitimate side hussle. 

In particular, I am on the Pegasus project with recruits experts from the STEM domain to help train some of the most powerful LLMs in the market. It is a challenging task, writing prompts that have the capacity to stump the AI models. You get paid a task score of $30 as Contributor A and depending on how well you did with the actual prompt, you can get incentives for such task that can be over $500. For those who are truly good in this, they get to make a lot of money. 

I know people are saying bad things about Outlier but that has not been my experience. I can only say good things about outlier.

You get paid every Tuesday and it goes straight to your Paypal account. 

The Quality Managers on the projects are very professional. You have a Community that hold yourselves to account and support you through the process.

You may also choose to work as  a Reviewer which again attracts a flat task rate of $50 per review but again your insentives for doing a good task can be quite high. 

The above is my experience with Pegasus but I know they are others that might not have such strong incentives scheme but they are all quite legitimate.

You have to however note that if you do not do a good task, you get booted out of the project or banned which can be quite upsetting.

I feel a lot of the bad reports about Outlier are people who have suffered this. 

If you are interested in training next generation AI models, then Outlier is a good place for you.",Outlier is a legitimate side hussle and I've made over $10k in 2 months,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fee664a25badbf45c1fa76

"Outlier is definitely a solid work option. I’ve been working here for about six months and would like to share some of my personal experiences.

Pros:

1. Good pay: Compared to the average salary in Taiwan, the compensation is quite attractive.

2. Fast payments: You get paid weekly, which really helps with cash flow.

3. Efficient communication: If there’s ever an issue, contacting the QM usually gets a quick and helpful response.

Cons:

1. Lack of stability: It’s hard to predict how long each project will last, which makes it tricky to plan work and rest time.

2. Subjective reviews: Some reviewers can be quite strict, and the standards may vary from person to person.

3. Frequent rule changes: Guidelines often get updated to meet client needs, so you need to stay flexible and adapt quickly.

If you’re looking for a source of extra income, Outlier is a great option. But if you’re relying on it as your main source of income, the uncertainty might cause a bit of anxiety.",Pros and Cons of Working at Outlier,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fee63bdcf4615caa1e5ec6

"Когда мне пришло письмо-приглашение подать заявку на работу в Outlier, я подумала, что это очередной спам на LinkedIn, но так как я действительно интересуюсь ИИ, то решила просто посмотреть что это. 
Я почитала отзывы - они были самые разные, но большинство было негативных. Именно поэтому, когда у меня теперь есть свой позитивный опыт, я решила написать свой собственный отзыв, потому что в душе я - борец за справедливость =))
Так как я была на тот момент без работы и мне все равно нечем было заняться, то я подумала, что даже если мой личный опыт будет тоже негативным, то и бог с ним - терять мне все равно нечего. 
Процесс регистрации стандартный для подобных платформ. Кого-то может смутить верификация (когда от вас требуют документы и снять себя на видео), но это только если вы никогда не имели с этим дело. По факту, это всего лишь часть стандартной процедуры на многих платформах. Никаких сверхъестественных личных данных с вас все равно не возьмут.
Вначале заданий было очень мало, были месяцы, когда вообще не было заданий. Так что рассматривать это как единственный источник дохода, особенно вначале не стоит.
Последних пару месяцев я работаю над интересным проектом на Outlier и очень всем довольна - работы достаточно, платят хорошо, команда подобралась отличная. Я кайфую. Надеюсь этот проект будет длится долго. Но даже если нет, я все равно благодарна Outlier за возможность принимать в нем участие. Тот редкий случай, когда мне нравится и работа и зарплата =))

Из минусов:
1. бывают недели (и месяцы) без проектов и это не зависит от твоего желания работать
2. заработанные деньги платят только на AIRtm или PayPal (нет возможности подключить другие способы приема денег, так что если у вас нет подключения к этим системам или в вашей стране ограничение на прием денег из этих систем, то вы не сможете получить свою зарплату)

Из плюсов: 
1. работа из дома
2. интересные проекты и всегда разные (для меня важно, чтоб работа не была скучной)
3. работа с ИИ
4. свободный график. Действительно свободный - нет дедлайнов, работай сколько и когда хочешь. Просто, если ты решил не делать задания, их заберет кто-то другой. В этом случае ты естественно не получишь оплату за эти задания, но это твой личный выбор и никто тебя за это не выгонит 
5. постоянные обучения (я люблю узнавать что-то новое, так что для меня это - большой плюс)
6. коллектив высокоинтеллектуальных и интересных людей
7. хорошая почасовая оплата
8. мне нравится думать, что мой маленький вклад в виде этой работы улучшает взаимодействие с ИИ, в том числе и для меня

Короче, мой личный опыт оказался очень позитивным. Я могу смело рекомендовать эту платформу",Я всем довольна! Мне нравится работать с ИИ и нравятся проекты на этой платформе,5,ru,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fee46ce6e24ad7dd47336d
"Outlier provided me an opportunity to use my advance mathematical skills and apply then to train state of the art LLMs/agents. I have been associated with the platform for more than a year and rely on it for my side hustle. The process is streamlined and users can update their skills and take assessment to prove their proficiency. People are matched based on the available projects. Each project would have its own onboarding document and community channel where team members exchange information and share common problems. In one of my projects we used to have weekly connects which helped a lot.

"I can say firsthand that Outlier is not a scam. It is one of my first jobs ever and I get paid more than 99% of teenagers (and most adults). 

Yes it is not the perfect job and it has some things that could be improved, however for the little requirement to get access to attempt to get accepted it is a no brainer in my opinion. Many people are too entitled, they see an online job that offers a certain amount of money an hour and when their application gets accepted they are angry that they are not bombarded with constant work, this is not Outlier's fault, it is the people's expectations. My expectations were low, for the amount of money I was promised to get paid an hour and without having to have multiple degrees I did not think it would be legit, but to my surprise it was legit. 

Most reviews I have seen here have talked about there being too many unpaid courses, to that I would say that is not something to complain about, it is a digital job where you can take courses to gain knowledge for free, you don't have to take the courses if you don't want to. The reason there are courses is for people to know how to do the work correctly, if there were no courses then you would not know how to properly perform the work and the quality of the work would not be good. People complain that the courses are unpaid, however in my experience the courses are not very long, I have taken at most 7 hours of courses in 3 months.

I make $30 an hour and I have never not gotten paid, I have had pretty much constant work available ever since I started Outlier, I have made over 6400 dollars so far and I am 18 years old, the job is fun, and the QM's (managers for projects) are really nice and they help with any questions I have. I myself have reviewed tasks from people and it's clear that many people do not read instructions and as a result get kicked out of the project because their work is low quality, then they go on and complain about not having any work available, you get what you put in. I have carefully read through the instructions to make sure I don't do anything wrong, and it has worked out pretty well. 

I do also have some things that could be improved, and it is not so much criticism, but more a suggestion to Outlier. First are a list of pros:
Constant available work (in my experience)
High pay ($30 an hour in my case, varies for other languages and expertise)
Kind, useful, and professional project managers
Incentives to work (missions to do a certain amount of tasks/hours and you get paid a bonus - I have made more than 800 dollars in bonuses so far, really good for incentive!)
Great community and communication with other people working
Weekly pay
Easy to get started
Fun and exciting work

Cons:
Instructions can be unclear and contradicting which can make it feel impossible to do tasks correctly (communication with QM usually clears it up)
You can get negative feedback on tasks you have done correctly, and getting the negative feedbacks removed is near impossible
Sometimes there are loading issues
The detection system for bans is not perfect, I myself have gotten banned on Outlier before (in my first month) I received an automatic response mail and was told the decision was final. I reached out to a moderator on Reddit and I as caught in a ban wave that caught many innocent people, I was luckily unbanned and allowed to task again a few days later. I know there are people that get banned when they haven't done anything wrong that don't get unbanned. When the work is remote and there are so many ways to cheat I fully understand why they have a strict detection system, however I think it could be improved by making it more clear how to not make the system incorrectly flag for cheating.

That is all I wanted to say. Overall a great company with great work conditions, and some improvements, however I have had a really positive experience and my biggest advice is to stay safe when working by not doing anything that you think can be seen as cheating or suspicious. I would recommend giving Outlier a try and as long as you put in solid work by reading the instructions and asking questions, I think you'll have a good time :)","Legit company, many people misunderstand Outlier",4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fee403254b172d5cc0e26c

Having worked on Outlier for some months now I have thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of the work including the process in which we have been asked to help improve AI. A big part for me in this journey has been to reflect on how I am playing my part in improving AI. 

Some minor reflections however....the variable nature of the work sometimes is frustrating but when you do get on a roll and work is consistent it is fantastic (especially the pay at the end of the period). Instructions have been relatively great although at times some of the instructions feel like they think you have a good understanding of AI and the mechanics of how it works.

"I've been working with Outlier for around a year now and I'll try to be as honest as possible.

The company is legit and pays as it promises every Tuesday of every week. The pay rate, which can be as little as 3/h and as high as 40/h, depends on the project and your expertise, although they are quite secret about how they determine it. In my experience, work has been quite consistent, with only a few days without projects assigned.

There are, however, three aspects that obscure the picture. Firstly, Outlier adds and removes you from projects constantly with little to no explanations, which forces workers to waste time learning about new project's guidelines. This can be quite frustrating and discourages people to own their work. Secondly, Outlier can change your max pay rate at any time. It has happened to me twice, first with a 20% reduction and then with a 15% reduction. It has never increased. And thirdly, instructions for each project are not that clear. Even though there are guidelines for each one. I've always found them confusing and without clue as to why I was removed from the training phase.

Overall, I do recommend it since it can be a great way to have an extra income, but it can be inconsistent and it won't be a work that you will fall in love with.",My honest review after 1 year,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fed6ea2d0ddc10874ff9eb
"I've been contracting with Outlier for over 6 months now. It's been great. I've worked on a variety of projects, and I've found all of them to be really interesting and challenging. Definitely not monotonous data entry! There's a lot of complex thinking and creativity involved. I have learned a lot, and I'm glad to be gaining a real understanding of what AI is and how it works. It feels quite exciting. It is gig work, so it doesn't have the consistency of a regular job, so occasionally you can feel a little lost in the woods when a project ends. But in my experience the next one always comes along, and the flexibility of work hours is great if you have other responsibilities you need to work around. I have always been paid for the time I've worked with no issues, and it's become increasingly lucrative as I've gained more tasking experience. There are discourse communities and zoom rooms for communication with other contributors, which is great for remote workers; we can help each other out and feel a little bit of a sense of 'team'.

"I've worked as a contributor on Outlier since October 2024 (I'm writing this in April 2025) and can wholeheartedly say that this company is not a scam. I've been regularly paid equal to more than what I would be earning in a ""normal"" job. Once or twice a week, every week. I've never not been paid. 

I have recently graduated with a PhD and am going through the process of applying to fellowships and post docs. The income made through Outlier has really reduced stress in the job hunting process.

I work probably between 10 - 20 hours a week, depending on what else I have going on at the time.

This is an honest review, so I think it's fair to say that sometimes the Outlier platform is frustrating. It's sometimes difficult or not intuitive to use, the on boarding isn't paid and sometimes the project ends and you are without work while they find you a new project (this happened for a max of 5 days for me).

"I'll start by saying that the opportunity Outlier presents is fantastic. As a STEM specialist, I've made nearly 20K in a year, which has changed my life for the better. Many of the Outlier projects are fun and engaging to work on.
Despite this, the platform is terribly run overall. The platform has onboarded a ton of bad actors and scammers that make life difficult for honest contributors like me, and as such, there are a ton of ban waves going around that have a lot of false positives. My account was ""permanently banned"" twice for no reason, and support tickets at Outlier are nearly entirely AI automated, so you can't even talk to a human when this happens. I had to reach out to the Outlier Community manager on Reddit to help get my account back, which took weeks and probably cost me over 1K in earnings. I was never given an apology (from an actual human) the first time or the second time...
The onboarding for the projects is all unpaid, and the grading of the assessments and quizzes in the onboarding is all AI-automated. This is a serious problem, as the onboarding quizzes often have blatant factual errors that get you removed from the project if you get the question correct. The people who make decisions on Outlier at the highest level tend to be very arrogant and unqualified, so mistakes like this are commonplace.
Senior Reviewers are often promoted completely randomly, so there's a good chance you will have someone far less skilled than you review your work, which can cause many problems. For instance, wether or not you are going to remain on a project depends a lot on the reviews of your first couple of tasks, and I've been kicked off more projects than I can count because of unqualified reviewers who completely misunderstood my task as well as the requirements of the project. They only recently added a button to dispute reviews, but they directly state that they might not have enough time to look at your dispute... 
The website is also highly glitchy, going down frequently, and can kick you out of a task midway through, causing you to lose money. As I said before, the support tickets are almost all AI bots, so getting anything fixed is extremely frustrating. 
There is almost no transparency when you are removed from a project, and it's nearly impossible to even find out why you were removed in most cases.
My overall advice is to take Outlier for what it is: a source of occasional extra money on the side. This platform is too volatile, inconsistent, and disorganized to ever be considered a full-time job. Some weeks, you will make 0$ through no fault of your own because the automated systems don't feel like assigning you to a project.

"The majority of online comments regarding Outlier are from people who haven't passed onboarding or may have been given limited access to an initial project. The reason they have eq and low access to tasks isn't an Outlier issue; it's because they haven't produced high-quality work. You will need to invest time onboarding and pass exams to gain access to projects, but this is normal for all online roles.

2.) Taskers are then periodically advised that they have active tasks to perform when no such tasks are available, or;
3.) Taskers are required to spend many hours without payment proving competency by performing the same AI improvement tasks for which they ostensibly will later be paid on successful completion of assessment.
4.) On completion of many rounds of step 3.) above, Outlier determines that the tasker is not qualified, or, more commonly, that no task is available, presumably because the taskers satisfied the entities paying Outlier for evaluation of its AI systems in the course of proving tasker fitness to perform the task.",Outlier.ai is a Scam:,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fe668392fe08b708b55892

"I am fairly confident that Outlier isn't a 'scam' in the traditional sense of the word, but it's a bizarre set up and some alarm bells will ring. The first thing you'll notice is that the user interface is outdated and riddled with typos. Then you'll find you have to hand over a lot of personal data - passport photos, videos of you answering questions etc. - all before you really know exactly what it is you'll be doing. I proceeded through this process out of sheer curiosity in the end. 

I was almost instantly invited to join a project once I had gone through all the hoops to join the platform, so there is work to be had. I then went through 2-3 hours of unpaid 'training and onboarding' for the project, which was based on writing challenging prompts related to your field of technical expertise. When I got through the onboarding, the tasks available were entirely unrelated to my field of expertise, despite me being 'matched' to the project based on my CV and skill set. 

More frustrating, there seems to be no way for me to decline to proceed with this project, so I have had to ignore other projects that have been matched to me while sitting here unable to do the first one. 

But, the most frustrating thing is that I wrote to support for help with this and I am genuinely now getting spammed by Outlier's support team. Nobody has answered my question, but since I raised the ticket I have had approximately 80 messages from the support system in about 2 days, all saying the same thing and all unrelated to my query. I raised another, separate ticket and have had no response.

"Es war unglaublich absurd.

Beim Onboarding hatten sämtliche Sprachtests nur Agrarwirtschaft und Klimawandel als Thema, obwohl ich mich mit völlig anderer Expertise beworben habe. Ebenfalls wurden etliche Fragen mehrfach wiederholt gestellt, so dass ich am Ende immer wieder das selbe schreiben und erzählen musste.

Die Aussagen stimmen, dass man stundenlang unbezahlte Tests für Projekte machen muss, um dann vielleicht oder auch nicht Projektmatches zu bekommen. 

Nachdem ich den ersten Test absolviert hatte, dessen Ergebnisse extrem intransparent kommuniziert wurden, war das Projekt, das dazugehörte, einfach mal von meinem Dashboard verschwunden. Entgegen den Behauptungen der Plattform ware ich auch nicht über das Projekt informiert worden, ich hatte es nur gesehen, weil ich zufällig eingeloggt war. Ich schrieb also ein Support-Ticket und fragte, was ich tun könnte, um in Zukunft zuverlässig über Projekte benachrichtigt zu werden und beschrieb diesen genauen Fall, also dass ein erfolgreich gematchtes Projekt nicht per Email angekündigt war. Der Support las meine Email wohl nur oberflächlich und schrieb auf eine Art zurück, die deutlich machte, dass sie glaubten, ich wollte mich über fehlende Arbeitsgelegenheiten beschweren. Ich wies sie darauf hin, meine Email nochmal zu lesen. Diesmal bekam ich eine neue Antwort, wieder komplett am Thema vorbei - irgendetwas zu Settings in Googlemail. ich nutze kein Googlemail. Ich schrieb auch nicht von einem Googlemailaccount.

Zeitgleich hatte ich eine zweite Supportanfrage laufen, weil ohne mein Zutun eine falsche Emailadresse für Paypal hinterlegt worden war (meine Paypal und Loginadressen sind unterschiedlich, ich hatte auch beide korrekt eingegeben, aber es war ohne mein Zutun geändert worden und somit lief die Bestätigungsüberweisung logischerweise ins Leere). Ich wollte die Adresse korrigieren, wurde aber gezwungen, den kompletten Legitimierungsprozess nochmal zu durchlaufen. Ich fragte über den Support an wieso, man schrieb mir zurück, man hätte mir einen 30-minütigen bypass eingeräumt, was gar nicht nötig war, ich hatte längt die Registrierung erneut abgeschlossen. Warum das überhaupt nötig war wurde mir nicht kommuniziert.

Zwischendurch tauchte unvermittelt das verschwundene Projekt wieder auf, mit einigen Tasks, die ich erfolgreich absolvierte und für die ich auch bezahlt wurde (knapp eine Stunde netto). Dann kamen tagelang keine neuen Tasks. Noch ein paar Tage später konnte ich mich (zufällig etwa zum selben Zeitpunkt, als ich intern einer Bitte um Bewertung des Supports mit einem von fünf Sternen wegen der vorherigen Probleme nachkam) plötzlich nicht mehr einloggen. Oberflächlich sah es wie ein Serverproblem aus, ich bekam ständig Timeout-Meldungen und 503-Fehler. Das hielt tagelang an, aber alle Uptime-Berichte zeigten an, Outlier sei online. Als ich dann auf einem anderen Browser versuchte, mich einzuloggen, las ich, mein Account sei gelöscht. Ich schrieb also das dritte Support-Ticket, diesmal gezwungenermaßen direkt per Mail. ich wies sie explizit auf die Aussperrung hin und bat um eine Erklärung. Wie man es ahnen kann - niemand hatte mir die Löschung kommuniziert.

Man antwortete mir lapidar, dass zu meiner Emailadresse kein Account gehöre. Da platzte mir so langsam der Kragen. Ende vom Lied: Der Service weigerte sich ""aus Sicherheitsgründen"" ohne klare Begründung, weiter über meine registrierte Emailadresse zu kommunizieren und ich sollte (von meinem gelöschten Account aus!) doch bitte das Dashboard frür weitere Kommunikation oder meine sekundäre Email nehmen. Ich habe ihnen dann freundlich aber bestimmt mitgeteilt, dass sie mich als Mitarbeiter sofort löschen sollten.

Ich habe noch nie so ein unprofessionelles Setup erlebt. Eine verwirrte Mail, das kann ja passieren, aber drei völlig sinnentleerte Kommunikationen hintereinander inklusive unbegründeter Aussperrung - das ist dann doch etwas zu viel. Aber Hauptsache sie haben meine komplette CV, etliche persönliche Daten und eine Arbeitsprobe... ein Schelm, wer sich Böses dabei denkt. Ich bereue es, mich dort je registriert zu haben. Ich kann nicht (mehr) beurteilen, ob das Portal legitim ist (Tasks und Preps wirkten jedenfalls so), aber selbst wenn, dann spottet die Unprofessionalität des Supports und Unausgereiftheit der Plattform jeder Beschreibung.

Und ja, auch ich habe als deutscher Muttersprachler mit philologischem Abschchluss den Projektabschlusstest angeblich knapp nicht bestanden, wie so viele andere Rezensenten auch.

Ich habe Outlier geschrieben, dass ich Ihnen die Speicherung und Nutzung meines CV und meiner persönlichen Daten mit sofortiger Wirkung untersage.

"Leider vollkommen ungeeignet für Texter oder Redakteure aus Deutschland. Ich habe mich dort aufgrund einer Anzeige gemeldet, die deutsche Texter suchte. Ich habe mich nach einer Woche enttäuscht wieder abgemeldet, denn bei meiner kurzen „Karriere“ geschah folgendes:
1. Ich erhielt lediglich englischsprachige Aufträge, bei denen Antworten von Sprachmodellen zu bewerten waren. Ich habe weder deutschsprachige Aufträge bekommen noch Aufträge für deutschsprachige Texte – musste also abseits meiner Kernkompetenz arbeiten.
2. Die Zeitvorgaben sind illusorisch. Zwar verstehe ich dank meiner Tätigkeit in der IT-Branche gut Englisch, doch die vorgeschriebene Zeit reicht nicht aus, um die teils sehr umfangreichen Begleitdokumente korrekt auszuwerten. Das ist auf Englisch für Nicht-Muttersprachler nicht zu schaffen; selbst Muttersprachler dürften hier Schwierigkeiten haben.
3. Die Aufgaben müssen in einer vorgegebenen Zeit erledigt werden. Bezahlt wird das nicht besonders hohe Honorar nur für die Zeitvorgabe, nicht für die tatsächlich aufgewendete Zeit. Für die „Überzeit“ wird ein reduzierter Honorarsatz bezahlt, aber nur bis zu einer Höchstgrenze.
4. Die Aufträge kamen immer zu US-Bürozeiten, also zwischen 23:00 und 1:00 Uhr in der Nacht. Die meisten waren rund 12 Stunden später abgelaufen, sodass ich sie nicht bearbeiten konnte. Ich schlage mir nicht die Nächte um die Ohren, da ich die Arbeit nur nutzen wollte, um in Leerlaufzeiten etwas Geld zu verdienen.
5. Zu jedem Auftrag gibt es umfangreiche Briefings und teils sogar Webinar-Videos, die vorher erledigt werden müssen – selbstverständlich unbezahlt. Einige Aufträge waren verschwunden, nachdem ich die Briefings durchgearbeitet hatte.
Fazit: Outlier ist ein typischer Akteur der „Gig Economy“. Oberflächlich sehen die Rahmenbedingungen gar nicht mal schlecht aus, geworben wird mit Honoraren von 49 $ pro Stunde, mit Aussicht auf mehr. In der Praxis lassen sich diese Honorare allerdings kaum erreichen – jedenfalls nicht mit fremdsprachigen Aufträgen.

"Outlier's parent company, Scale AI, is run by a bunch of bullies and criminals. The biggest thing Scale doesn't like is when people speak out against their unethical---and often illegal---practices. If you Google Scale AI, you'll find a dozen or so articles covering the Department of Labor's investigation into Scale for unpaid wages, worker misclassification, and worker retaliation.

Internally for everyday practices, Scale goes out of its way to prevent dissent; if you speak out against Scale's leadership, their fake HR begins plotting ways to get rid of you. Everything at Scale is crafted in such a way to fire U.S. employees so they can replace them with low paid workers they exploit from Mexico or Argentina. 

They run an internal quality program where they have an incompetent department vet audits from overworked employees who are already working several hours over 40 (but not getting paid overtime). A single bad score can put you on the chopping block if Scale wants an excuse to fire you---either because you spoke out against Scale's unethical practices, you crossed someone higher up, or simply because they're trying to cut costs since Scale is terrible at managing money and resources. 

The person running much of the operations has no idea what she's doing as any new idea she implements fails (though Scaliens have too much of an ego to admit when they've made a mistake) and any pushback on her thoughtless implementations or criticism of the negative culture she's cultivated is met with her plotting to fire people because she's a bully who lacks even the most basic empathy. (She's also so out of touch that she asked if people used Google applications like GDocs to complete work and wanted to disconnect people's use of said applications, likely so her and her minions could scrub away evidence or she's truly missing many braincells.)

This, of course, creates a very hostile work environment where everyone fears for their job; you either have to put your head down and say nothing despite everything being on fire and not working properly or you become a bootlicker ratting on other vulnerable employees to appear valuable and loyal. Of course, you CAN speak out, but by doing so, there's a good chance you won't have your job in a week or two.

Now, given that Scale treats many of their W2 employees like they're disposable garbage, imagine how Scale treats 1099 contractors via Outlier.

Should you work here? I wouldn't; you might be one of the lucky few that can get on a decent project and make decent money but, more likely than not, you'll be bounced around from project to project, forced to take unpaid trainings and when you finally get a task, it'll often be the only one before they run out then you'll be sitting staring at a blank screen or you'll get onto another project and repeat the cycle of unpaid trainings followed by an abysmal account of low paying tasks to do.","Outlier's parent company, Scale AI, is run by bullies and criminals",1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f7b44fb22f1e617416f138

"Il lavoro esiste ed è relativamente ben pagato, se non fosse che si dovrebbe capire già che comunque qualcosa non va dalla facilità con cui si viene assunti. Come già detto da altri ex “dipendenti” (in realtà si è freelancer) in alcune recensioni, ogni task ha una durata massima di tempo oltre il quale non solo scade il task e non lo si può più completare, ma non si viene neanche pagati per il tempo impiegato a lavorare sul task fino a quel momento. Certo, dopo un po’ ci si adatta e si cerca di rientrare nei tempi giusti la maggior parte delle volte, ma questi tempi ‘giusti’, in fondo, non lo sono, perché i task in questione richiedono maggior attenzione e tempo di quello che si ha effettivamente a disposizione. Ad ogni modo, questo è il male minore, dal momento che finché c’è lavoro, ci si può lamentare fino a un certo punto. 

I problemi su questa piattaforma arrivano quando, dopo un tot di mesi trascorsi a lavorare su un progetto abbastanza consistente, questo viene interrotto dal cliente e si rimane in EQ (empty queue, senza progetti a disposizione). Prima iniziano col mandare task solo ad orari notturni improponibili, poi dicono che il progetto è in pausa per un po’, poi ricomincia e loro ti rimuovono senza alcuna spiegazione, e tu neanche te ne rendi conto finché non realizzi che è passato troppo tempo dall'ultima volta in cui hai lavorato a qualcosa, e in chat i nuovi assunti iniziano a discutere del progetto a cui stanno lavorando. Infatti, nel frattempo, potete tranquillamente vedere ogni settimana un nuovo processo di onboarding di migliaia di nuovi freelancer, mentre a quelli che già lavoravano da mesi o settimane vien detto che non c’è lavoro (dunque perché assumere altra gente?). 

Quando si chiedono chiarimenti ai QM (queue managers, o qualsiasi sia il loro mestiere - in realtà, sembrano ragazzini messi lì solo per dire “noi non decidiamo niente, è così, cercate di non ripetere sempre le stesse domande in chat”, rivelandosi più che altro semplici moderatori di un forum), questi rispondono in maniera vaga, finché non decidono bene di non rispondere più, chiudere i topic in cui si fanno domande, cosicché nessuno possa più stressarli, e non mettono neanche più a disposizione le office hours e war room in cui prima si potevano chiedere aiuto e chiarimenti in videochiamata. 

Insomma, si fanno tanti training (non retribuiti), si lavora in maniera costante per mesi, la paga arriva giusta e puntuale ogni settimana, ma dopo un tot si vien fatti fuori senza spiegazioni o con motivazioni totalmente inventate, della serie che non si è superato un determinato test (mai fatto). Lo consiglio solo a chi ha voglia di perdere un po’ di tempo e arrotondare uno stipendio fisso per qualche mese. Per Outlier siamo numeri più che per ogni altra azienda, e deve necessariamente esserci uno schema dietro questo modo di agire di cui noi non siamo consapevoli se si considera il ricambio SETTIMANALE di freelancer all’interno di questa piattaforma.

"Complete scam - Spent countless hours (UNPAID) onboarding for each different ""task"" only to find out there were no tasks available.  Many times you never even knew if you passed the exam for each task. Then each tasks is graded by a peer and the grading is all over the board.  For example, I had one that the reviewer said I did perfectly, but only gave me a 3 out of 5??!!  Then they don't grade certain tasks which keeps your score low.  Then if you all of a sudden get a couple of 2's you are kicked off the task.  So basically there is no way to be successful with this company.  It would be one thing if they gave you a CHANCE to understand what was wrong on a task and improve but they simply kick you off a task.  Then you spend hours onboarding for the next task for free and then there are no tasks available.  On some of the tasks they stated a certain amount per hour - say $25 and then a few weeks later the amount would change to like $15/hr.  Who is going to do it at $15 an hour when you have to pay your own self employment taxes out of that AND double social security?

"I’m seeing a lot of talk about this being a scam company so I had to share my honest experience. First off, Outlier/remotasks is a solid community with stable projects and work available for those who pass the skill assessments. Second, I’ve been on the platform (remotasks) now outlier, since 2023 and it has been a life saver! As a dad of two busy young ones, I’ve been able to work a schedule that truly is flexible and perfectly accommodated my life. The hours aren’t capped, and aren’t enforced too! Meaning, you can work however many hours you choose to; long or short (as long as there are projects that align with your skills available).

"The main issue with Outlier is that most of the work you do is peer reviewed, and the quality of the reviewing is so poor and inconsistent that even if you produce very high quality work, it is 50/50 whether or not you get an accurate rating for it. There are feedback dispute forms to make you feel like there is some recourse, but these are like a decoy, no one actually reads or responds to them. Neither the project managers (known as 'QMs') nor the platform itself have a real process for rooting out bad reviewers or double checking their work. So you can waste your time doing unpaid trainings and assessments (you'll be spending more time on these than actually working/earning, so the hourly rate ends up being way below minimum wage), produce really high quality work that requires a lot of brainpower and subject expertise, receive consistent 5/5 reviews for your work, only to suddenly be kicked off the project because of inaccurate ratings within a couple of days. There are many other serious issues with Outlier; sometimes you'll be invited to join a project that matches your skills, spend hours doing unpaid onboarding, and then it will just disappear from your dashboard with no explanation. The site isn't a scam, you can actually get paid, but it is so unreliable and difficult to get consistent work that I would recommend avoiding it altogether, unless you literally have no choice. That's the sad thing about this platform, it is exploiting people who are desperate and don't have an alternative. It's not good for the AI companies using their service either, they're pouring their money down the drain for what is often very low quality work, which has to be re-written multiple times. They'd be better off hiring full-time in-house staff, it would save them money and give people working on prompts some job security.","Exploitative, unreliable, don't waste your time",1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67e5430e19da59b5a5a96787

"Ich bin stark enttäuscht. Ich habe jetzt etwa 10 Wochen für Outlier gearbeitet. Am Anfang war es super. Outlier zahlte mir 29 Dollar pro Stunde und ich bekam das Geld wöchentlich über Paypal. Ich hatte richtig viel Spaß und wurde durch eine Menge Geld bestätigt. Wobei 29 Dollar pro Stunde nun auch nicht das Gelbe vom Ei ist. Aber wenn man arbeitet, weil man Bock hat, sieht man das nicht so eng.

Dann versiegte die Arbeit und ich hatte drei Wochen überhaupt nichts zu tun. Ich aktualisierte mehrfach täglich mein Outlier-Dashboard, aber da kam nichts, außer die Info, dass es keine Arbeit gab (""EQ"", Empty Queue). Und dann schließliclh wurde ein neues Projekt gestartet, und die Dinge überschlugen sich ... 

Das Ende vom Lied war, dass ich nicht die richtigen Infos bekam, um das Projekt korrekt durchzuführen, und dass ich einen Schwung wirklich schlechter Bewertungen bekam, die dazu führten, dass man mich aus dem Projket abzog. Ohne Kommentar. Mitte Februar hatte man mich zu einem besonders herausragenden Mitarbeiter mit Sonderrechten gekürt, Mitte März empfand man mich als so schlecht, dass man nicht mal mehr mit mir sprach.

Die Bewertungen waren willkürlich. Mal gefiel einem Reviewer mein Thema nicht, mal war eine bestimmte Sache falsch, mal war genau dieselbe Sache besonders gut. Jeder entschied anders, und genauso wild fielen dann meine Reviews aus. 

Um auf dem Laufenden zu bleiben, muss man sich bei Outlier massiv bemühen, die notwendigen Infos zu bekommen. Es gibt nicht das eine Dokument, das man durcharbeiten kann. Oder das eine (oder zwei oder drei) Webinar, das einen fit macht für den Job. Es gibt viele verschiedene Informationsquellen, die allesamt nach und nach im Chat veröffenltich werden, und wenn man zufällig mal nicht hingeguckt hat, hat man eine Info oder ein Webniar verpasst. Man kann im Chat oder in Online-Meetings zwar nachfragen, wenn man Zweifel hat, aber wie fragt man nach Dingen, von denen man nicht weißt, dass man sie nicht weiß?

Ich hatte eine meiner wirklich verrückten Bewertungen an einen Quality Manager weitergeleitet. Er stimmte zu, dass meine Arbeit 5 Sterne und nicht nur 1 wert war - unternehmen konnte er jedoch nichts gegen die falsche Bewertung. Man ist völlig der Willkür der Reviewer ausgesetzt, die selbst oft gar nicht wissen, dass sie Reviewer sind und genau dieselben mangelhaften Informationen haben wie die Leute, die die Aufgaben ausführen.

Ich hatte Outlier anfangs natürlich gegoogelt und viele schlechte Kritiken gelesen. Ich dachte, sie wären alle falsch. Bei mir lief es anfangs doch so super. Jetzt, rückblickend, waren sie wohl doch richtig. Wenn man einen ""Lauf"" hat, kann es flutschen, vor allem dann, wenn man rund um die Uhr bei Outlier online sein kann. Aber wenn man mal ein Wochenende nicht online ist, verpasst man ein Webniar, und schwupps, schon ist man raus. 

Ah. Und es ist auch nicht so, dass man zeitunabhängig arbeiten kann. Theoretisch wohl, praktisch nicht. Outlier arbeitet nach dem ""First-come-first-serve""-Prinzip. Ein ""Batch"" wird einem ""Pod"" von Mitarbeitern zugewiesen. Wer die Arbeit macht, ist zufällig. Man muss also arbeiten, wenn Arbeit da ist. Wartet man bis zum nächsten Morgen, ist der aktuelle ""Batch"" schon wieder von anderen Mitarbeitern in anderen Zeitzonen abgearbeitet worden und man findet nur ""EQ"" (Empty Queue, keine Arbeit) auf seinem Desktop.

Die Arbeit hat mir Spaß gemacht. Es wäre ein cooler Nebenverdienst gewesen. Aber ich verdiene mehr in meinem eigentlichen Job und kann es mir nicht leisten, 24/7 auf Outlier abzuhängen, um bloß keine Infos zu verpassen. Am Wochenende hätte ich ein Webinar machen können, aber ich zog es vor, mit meiner Familie Kaffee zu trinken (es war schließlich Sonntag). Heute ist das Webinar (und damit die Möglichkeit, mich für ein Projekt zu qualifizieren) verpufft.

Outlier ist legitim, man wird nicht betrogen, aber die Arbeitsbedingungen sind so schwierig, dass ich es nicht empfehlen würde.","Interessante Arbeit, grottenschlechte Organisation",2,de,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67e19ff5dd542c98a37c96b2

"I have worked with Outlier for over a year now, and my experience has been quite positive. I work at Outlier in a part-time capacity. The main differentiating factor is the job’s requirement for critical thinking and technical skills. It is not easy to find part-time jobs that actually involve reasoning or professional skills, so this factor is quite a selling point for me.

Another advantage of working at Outlier is the pay. I have received two pay raises without asking for them. The platform evaluates everyone’s performance and adjusts pay accordingly. If you’re skilled in one of their domains, your talent will be recognized. Without disclosing my pay, I can confidently say that no other part time opportunity offers anything close. It’s on par with my full time hourly salary.

There are of course imperfections. Because the job involves an online platform operating 24/7, there are going to be some bugs. In my experience, I haven’t had anything that’s difficult to resolve. Maybe that’s because I’m lucky. Another potential point of frustration involves getting incorrect evaluations when you work. It’s not common for me, and they are mostly balanced out by evaluations that are kind and helpful.

"This job pays really well, especially for coders, but has almost no positional security. You could be making $2000 or even more one week but then $32.51 the next week. I’ve been on the platform for about a year and my lifetime earnings are almost approaching $30k, which is with the large work gaps and usually working less than 15 hours per week. If this job let you work 40 hours per week, I’m confident I’d be making 100k~200k, somewhere in that range. However, there’s a few strings tied that prevent me from giving it 5 stars. While the money is real (despite online misinformation) and you get paid weekly (Tuesday, plus 2 days for the money to go in the account) the amount of money you get paid is dependent on many factors and often times variables out of your control. If you are not given a project, your income will be $0, but if you’re given a project with consistent missions (usually most coding ones), you get enormous sums of money in just hours of work. If you have a project, you’re typically invited as an attempter, meaning you do the initial work. However, their system has several ranks above that, including reviewers, senior reviewers, etc. to fix potential errors attempters might make. As someone who’s been through all the ranks, I would say this job can give you a roller coaster of feelings. One week you’re getting double or even triple promoted because you’re doing good work, the next week you notice a reviewer gave you a bad score because they’re not following the directions, and if another one follows, you’re almost certain to be staying up wondering if your rank might disappear. Some projects have good processes to talk it out with staff, but others have poor communication, so it’s once again a roll of the dice. About a month ago, I lost my Oracle rank because of several bad reviews on my tasks and a delay in the release of the dispute form, which I submitted immediately after it was available. During this time, I experienced a few queue outages (where you have no work you’re allowed to do) but upon getting back into a project, I’m making well above the money a college student is expected to have. Without Outlier, I don’t know where I would likely be in extreme debt, but because of my several years of pre-college coding experience, I’m now able to pay my tuition out of pocket and live comfortably with the income off this platform. I still feel like outlier could use many improvements, and a lot of the time the platform has felt opaque in the past, but they’ve been improving their transparency, especially a lot recently. I think if you have a job that makes just a small amount of money on the side, you can spend more time on this job to make a fortune while still having a little financial security in case it disappears from projects disbanding, bad reviews, or other things that happen inside the platform. Don’t come here if you’re expecting the job of your life, but do come here if you want to stay at home, have to handle occasional issues, but still have an average income well above what you’d make at a regular job with less time put into it.

"Beware of this company. After working for a year, I have reached my limit!

Recruitment and Onboarding 

I was recruited (03/24) via Linked-In and promised $50/h to evaluate AI responses. I was paid ~$20/h during onboarding. With two conflicting accounts, my onboarding was delayed requiring significant time to resolve the issue. Then my account was frozen. Although hired for chemistry tasks, I failed the onboarding because I couldn't evaluate AI responses regarding TV shows and Pokemon. It was not a pleasant experience! I was promised a second chance if a new project required chemistry. After 5-6 months of emails promising work that didn't exist, I was finally put on the Mail Valley project (10/24).

Mail Valley Project 

This time, onboarding was related to my expertise and I passed! I was quickly promoted to reviewer status and even contacted by an executive of Scale Labs to discuss how things were going. I finally felt treated as a person rather than an anonymous resource to company initiatives. Things were manageable, but just for a few months.

Projects, Webinars, and Training

In order to stay current I regularly attended 3-6 ""optional"" unpaid webinars each week. Despite being told by the executive from Scale Labs we should get paid for webinars, I was never paid, even when the webinars were required. Webinars were usually an hour, but I was only given 4-10 hours notice to work them into my schedule. Weekend, late night, and even early morning webinars happened. My last required webinar was at 5:30-am!

New, unexpected, and unpaid training courses (1-6 hours) regularly populated my homepage that I was required to complete and pass to continue working. Sometimes the quizzes and tasking requirements were ambiguous making passing difficult.

Occasionally there was down time. I would choose another project and have hours of unpaid training courses with no assurance they keep me. Despite my best and most sincere efforts, being unjustifiably removed from a project without warning was deflating and common.

Tasking

Each project had a base rate with a time limit per task. For example, I had 50 minutes to write a unique prompt (question), solve the problem, come up with multiple-choice answers, and assess the Model's response. If the Model was not stumped, I would modify or rewrite the prompt. After 50 minutes, my pay rate dropped to ~40% the base rate. Usually the time limit was reasonable, but a significant portion of my time inevitably was paid at the lower rate. If I never stumped the Model, I couldn't submit the task and I wouldn't get paid.

Tasks were randomly assigned to me within specific topics. Oftentimes the topic was slightly outside of my area of expertise. Instead of being able to simply choose my topic from a list, I had to keep skipping tasks without being paid until I got an appropriate task.

Incentives

At first incentives were reasonable, e.g., work 4-6 hours per day for an extra $100; but then they became unreasonable, encouraging a very unhealthy work/life balance, e.g., work 5 hours for $22.50 or 10 hours for $77.50. Usually 10 hours of work was actually 12+ hours as I spent a lot of unpaid time skipping tasks, or not being able to stump the Model. Nobody should be encouraged to 12-hour days!

Promotions?

My status of ""attempter"" or ""reviewer"" changed without notice or explanation, affecting incentives. Just before the Mail Valley V2 project was initiated, I was asked to be a Squad Reviewer. It promised better incentives by managing 10-15 attempters. I was informed that I was part of the ""best-of-the-best"" that Outlier had. I interviewed, but respectfully declined due to potential conflicts with my full-time job. However, I kept receiving emails. Assuming they still wanted me, I completed and passed the unpaid onboarding. I was given a squad and paid the incentive for one week, but off boarded without notice, and immediately invited back via email to join their webinars, to only be told again I was off-boarded!

I was promised this would not affect my current status as reviewer, but it did. I am now back to just an attempter with zero incentives, constantly receiving negative feedback from poorly informed new reviewers and having to dispute more than half my tasks. I can no longer take the daily unjustified criticisms. My job has become unbearable, I don't know why, and I have no recourse!

Conclusion

I worked diligently for Outlier, providing high-quality work that qualified me to be a reviewer and a Squad Reviewer. But in the end, it's apparent I've always been  an anonymous, disposable lackey working to meet the demands of an undisclosed ""Customer"". I feel so used and unappreciated!

"You would think that a company like this would do their best *not* to alienate any competent contributors... Even though there are parts that appear smooth and well-running, there is a lot of chaos underneath. I had two debacles from the very beginning that really undermined my faith in the company. The first one was solved to my satisfaction, the second is still pending. I think the system is geared so strongly against any cheating and subpar work that it simultaneously cuts off decent, competent contributors due to glitches or honest mistakes. 

I originally signed up because of an ad where they were looking for programmers competent in the Danish language. However, their language assessment had some confusing features, such as a ""start recording"" button that was way off to the side and made me mess it up on the first try. Laughably, the system then deemed my Danish skills insufficient and was incredibly rigid about it. I contacted support several times to explain the situation and got a lot of contradictory feedback. One supporter insisted that I had to choose between either coding or language, which made no sense given what I signed up for. Eventually one supporter came through and re-enabled the language assessment, which I then passed. (BTW I noticed they had improved on the non-intuitive setup in the meantime.) 

Having passed Danish and python, I was then able to hop on the project I signed up for in the first place (Danish + python) and despite a steep onboarding process and learning curve, I started doing tasks, earning money and beginning to see the light again. 

Then on a Monday I wanted to spend all evening doing tasks, I discovered to my surprise I was kicked off the project because of ""low quality work"". As I was still gauging the project's standards, I wondered what I failed on, until I saw the feedback on the specific task that triggered this. I immediately recognized the prompt as part of a task of which I was asked to evaluate reviewer feedback. This was a prompt and code revision done by someone else and the reviewer was highly critical of the quality of the original work. Back when I was doing this task, I was at first unsure what was expected of me, because the instructions were terse. I could not really correct the work, because most of the fields were locked. I made a few changes to some of the fields that for some reason were not locked, until I discovered all I needed to do was give the reviewer feedback a thumbs up or down.  

Now when I log on to my dashboard, the scathing review of low quality work of the original author is under my feedback tab for me to ""acknowledge"". But I am not the author of this work, so why is this pinned on me? I suspect what happened is that the few fields that I could edit set me as the last editor of this work and subsequently the system assumed that I am now responsible. 

I have written back and forth to support a couple of times, but they don't really take the time to truly understand my issue and really investigate what happened here. All I get are boilerplate answers.

"Entre a Outlier el 4 de diciembre del 2024, realice los cursos por mera curiosidad, al principio me llegaban proyectos que desaparecían al otro día, no sacaba mas de 40 o 50 dólares en aquellas semanas. Pasaron los días y me mantuve constante como si tratara de desvelar un misterio, luego de 2 semanas me llegaron proyectos algo mas estables y casi nunca me quedaba en EQ, así ha sido hasta el día de hoy, en un total de casi 2 meses pude obtener 1700 dólares que son casi 5 salarios mínimos mensuales en mi país, yo trabajo como Cloud Engineer remotamente, Outlier no es mi fuente de ingreso principal y podía realizar ambas cosas a la par casi sin despeinarme, lo cual me parece buenísimo. Así llegara a desaparecer, retener un pago o removerme de la plataforma, me sentiría agradecido por la oportunidad ya que con mucho menos esfuerzo que un trabajo regular saque un dinero extra que me sirvió para muchas cosas. Entiendo la frustración y decepción de algunos ya que se habrán imaginado que Outlier es una plataforma de compensación inmediata o que podría trabajarse como fuente de ingresos principal pero no.... le recomende a un amigo la plataforma pero no hacia los cursos correctamente y no avanzaba los assessment, tampoco se preocupaba por reportar requerimientos para avanzar con los proyectos, un gil de pies a cabeza, por su incapacidad solo le quedo concluir que era una estafa cuando simplemente no es para todos ya que como cualquier otra platafoma tiene errores técnicos de cuando en vez, debemos recordar que el mundo no nos debe nada solo por existir, si necesitas ganar una habilidad al principio cuesta pero luego se vuelve algo tan sencillo que puedes llevar a la par de tu trabajo y eso es algo que muchos no quieren entender.

So, once your account is categorized as problematic, all you can do is wait for an account audit, which could take an unknown amount of time.

"Despite my experience with this company, I will set my personal feelings aside long enough to be fair. There are at least five things preventing this review from being a complete one-star: 
1. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually got paid--on time. And consistently, I might add, whenever there was work.

2. Some of the content I worked on was really interesting and worth exploring further, assuming I had been given the chance to do so.

3. There were Personal Wellness Surveys and forums, even if I'm not sure if anything came out of them.

4. We had our own personal AI playground to experiment with for personal (not work) use.

5. The reviewers that evaluated my work were (mostly) fair.

That aside, my time with Outlier has been an emotional roller coaster ride since last year due to the following:
1. receiving assessments and being kicked off projects without being told where I went wrong or how I can improve.  

2. technical glitches on the platform that made work impossible (e.g. overly demanding linter errors that did not permit me to progress with work)

3. long periods of empty queues that forced me to wait for weeks before new work came in

4. a mostly unhelpful Support system that consisted of, ironically, AI-generated messages (Messaging Team Leaders or Quality Assurance Managers gets better results.). When actual people responded to my messages, it was too late to do anything about it because the project had already passed.

5. The most recent blow came in the form of sudden account cancellation without any warning or notice. If I had done anything wrong to warrant this, it would have been nice (and professional) to have received a warning so that I had time to correct any errant behavior. Instead, I got a slap in the face in exchange for the time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears I invested in onboarding and working on all those projects. A quick search of Internet forums confirmed my suspicions that I am not alone in my experience. I e-mailed the Support Team several days ago regarding the matter and they have yet to respond. 

I'm not holding my breath.

It's saddening because Outlier had so much potential to be a good, consistent source of income. Unfortunately, the problems that plagued it turned it into a series of hassles that made it a challenge to work with. Due to this recent setback, I'll be knocking on other doors from now on and possibly working for their competitors instead. 

For those of you still with Outlier, I strongly recommend against overly depending on the company for your bread and butter. It is, it seems, a temporary side hustle at best. Make the most of it while you can.

Update: I just received an e-mail from Outlier Support claiming I have violated their guidelines by using forbidden tools to complete tasks, which is utter bullshit. I responded by contesting the claim and stating that I had only used Grammarly to proofread my text's Grammar. I have asked them to provide proof of my forbidden technology use.

When you are officially onto a project and have work available, you are paid well and have the freedom to work whenever you want. That's pretty standard, but moving on to the negatives. When you are not on a project and have to do onboarding, it feels like you are learning many guidelines just to not have any work. It's very common to constantly onboard different projects, but you will either fail the assessment for no apparent reason or have no tasks when completing the long onboarding process. This happens very often, especially when your main project is paused or completed.

The pay is adequate, and I'm confident that once I become more proficient and knowledgeable in the field, that will change in the fullness of time, but as of now I am content. There are no benefits as far as medical and retirement, but I expected that as this is a position that is technically freelance that I took upon myself to do full-time, so that is not a negative point for me. 

I have been on board with Outlier for a year this month. While there a few hiccups that they work diligently to iron out, there is nothing I can think of that makes me think twice about my employment here. Any questions I have are answered relatively quickly, any problems I have the QMs do their best to break down and explain (and even give hints), and their bi-weekly webinars and instructional guides are informative.

"Strangely, below are positive reviews. However I was ""stuck in onboarding"" for 8 weeks. Yesterday my account got blocked, and then - after I contacted support and asked ""why?"" - canceled. They accuse me I had cheated. See below.

""""""
After a careful manual review, I can tell you that your account has been disabled due to platform misuse. This includes using outside help, automated tools, or third-party materials to complete deliverable or assessment tasks in projects where they are not allowed, all of which violate our Community Guidelines.
[...]
This decision is final, and we will not consider further appeals on this matter.
[...]
""""""

Of course this is utter nonsense. What actually would one manually review? 

However I just noticed the final line in the quoted text: the decision is final

What a laugh, my quality solving their problems is so good, they think I cheated?

Background, I did 4 assessments, only the last one paid. Except for the first one, which was basic introduction, all others had serious problems in the setup of the tasks. 

I spent about 100h and earned in total $17, while my work was sending emails to them explaining why this assessment and that assessment is wrong. And I sent the fixes as good as I could.

Can absolutely not recommend. Reading their forum: they ""hired"" 100 times more people as they have work for. Everyone is in ""empty queue"" state. The ""market place"" is always completely empty. You can not even see potential matches.
You can not adjust your skill set. I signed up for software development related AI training.
The only paid job, with dozens of mistakes in the setup, was comparing 2x AI output of a summary of meeting notes. One of the summaries was in the prompt field. The rest of the task invisible at that time. You were asked if you understand it, not really realizing, ""oh, that is an response and not the prompt!"" After saying, ""okay, go on"": that damn field got greyed out!!! If it had been the prompt, you could not refer back to it later during work!!
So, then you have to evaluate Response1 and Response2. Surprisingly or not: the prompt was in Response1. Not the ""hidden prompt"" form before, but the real prompt. So: now I am supposed to compare the Respons1 versus the prompt, when the prompt is in the wrong text field, and the real Response1 is invisible in the greyed out text? 

And for fixing all those problems, and sending emails with solutions etc. I get flagged as: he cheated, used AI or had external help.

Ridiculous. But I take it as compliment that they consider my effort to help them as cheating. (The long story about impossible prompts and hints for software problems, I spare you here)",Either Fraud or Super Unprofessional,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a47711efec82e77fa3fb51

"I feel compelled to share my experience working with this company to help other professionals make informed decisions. My account was suspended without explanation just before the scheduled Tuesday payday, after completing contracted work. This appears to be a systematic practice of wage theft that prevents hardworking contractors from receiving compensation for their completed work.

The company's business model involves accepting international contracts and distributing them to workers, but their practices raise serious ethical concerns. They demonstrate a pattern of:
- Maintaining communication until work is completed
- Suspending accounts without valid justification right before scheduled payments
- Providing no transparent dispute resolution process
- Exploiting international contractors who have limited recourse

This conduct is not only unethical but potentially violates labor laws regarding fair compensation. The company's actions show a concerning disregard for workers' rights and professional integrity. I strongly advise other contractors to exercise extreme caution and thoroughly document all interactions if considering work with this organization.

My experience suggests their business practices are designed to take advantage of workers' time, expertise, and professional contributions without proper compensation.",URGENT WARNING: Systematic Wage Theft and Unethical Business Practices - Workers Beware ,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a354c7c2cfd5a29faf5392

"I know a lot of people have shared stories about Outlier's empty queues and mistreatment, but my story is about outright deception.

Through the company BrainTrust, I was contracted to be a T3 coder by Outlier when it used to be called Remotasks in November of 2023. I took the coding certification exam and got a 5 out of 5 on it.

Excited to start, I began working on projects, but noticed my pay rate was HALF of what I had been promised. After contacting support several times, I found out that my worker tag was a T1 coder. I asked them why and they weren't helpful.

For the past year, I've been contacting support about this. I've also been contacting Outlier's liaison for BrainTrust. I won't say his name, but his initials are G.R., and he's a program manager for Scale AI. I explained my situation and even provided proof, which was a screenshot of my dashboard showing the 5/5 test result. But he dismissed it as if it didn't matter. He told me that I was demoted to a T1 because I didn't perform well on the exam. I asked him if he had any proof because I remember the exam being very easy, and he didn't reply. Nothing back. His attitude was basically: ""Yes, we screwed you over. Deal with it.""

I also contacted BrainTrust but they said that only Outlier could do something about it. I remember after the exam receiving an email saying I passed. There was nothing in the email saying I performed poorly. My Remotasks dashboard back then said I got a 5/5 and I still have the screenshot of it. 

So yes, I'm not happy about this situation. No one in my situation would be happy about it. I even asked support to ""reset"" my profile and give me the test again to prove that I should be a T3 coder. I never failed the exam in the first place and my years of experience and Master of Science degree indicate that I should be a T3 coder.

This whole experience has been frustrating. I hope Outlier takes a closer look at cases like mine and ensures fairness for everyone they work with.

"Overall, my experience was mixed...and here is why.

     The beginning was great (with the exception that my son wanted to attempt to do some on the site under my name to prove he was smarter than me) and there was no way for me to get the testing reset, which presented issue later on. I had not actually taken the testing myself, but my son did and of course failed miserably as he was only 15 at the time. After this occurred, there was absolutely no way for this to be fixed in order for me to take the testing for myself to be qualified to do any work on the site whatsoever. So, in essence, I could not do any side work whatsoever on the platform. I did then receive an email asking for some assistance with a project they were conducting with small business data and ""Yes'! I qualify for that...

     Let's move ahead to the SMB data project. I submitted multiple datasets from October 2023 to February 2024. Payment for these datasets was supposed to be within 30 days of approval. I did not receive the last bit of payment for my datasets until October of 2024 although the datasets had been approved by April 2024. The project was a complete disaster, payment was not received for a couple of the datasets and I literally had to wait for over 4 months in order to receive payments having to go back and forth with multiple people until the situation was finally rectified. They could have offered me something extra for the hassle and wait, but they didn't. I guess that I should be grateful that they paid me for what they did. 

     If you want to question if you will be paid for what you submit, this company will pay you eventually. It may be on time, it may not. I cannot speak on the daily work opportunities that they have available, because I was unable to do any because of my son trying to prove something and them having absolutely no way to reset things in order for me to fix things and take the assessments on my own. I know that my personal experience working on the Bulba ICE SMB project, it took me an incredibly long time to receive all of my pay for that project, Legal action from a group of us had to be called in order to have the situation fully resolve. 

     I say if you want to take the chance, go for it. It seemed great to me to begin with, but as I said, I cannot speak on most due to me not being able to fulfill any work other than my work on the SMB project that took an incredibly long time to conclude everything. I like being paid..

     As of today, I still have an account, however, there is never any work available for me to do. I suppose that is due to the assessments my son did, or it could be due to the issues related to the SMB project...I am not sure which, or it could be both. Either way, they do not have it where I can make any money any longer on their platform. I hope those who dare fare better than the overwhelming majority of us did.

"I was happily working on a project, and got excellent reviews on it, but Oulier moved me to a ""priority"" project where I didn't get the chance to complete one task. At the same time, they removed my ability to work on any other projects. Now that the priority project is over, I have no work to do. They removed access to the project I was happy working on besides the fact that the Quality Manager from that project told me that I should still be there. I have no work to do despite good ratings. You contact support about it and those imbeciles don't even read your messages. 

Also, most of the positive reviews on this site are fake. There's a thread on Reddit about how people are getting paid $25 by Outlier to post positive reviews on Trustpilot.

This project removal thing to a ""priority"" project has happened to me 3 times in 4 months. I was happily working on a project, switched to a different one with no say in the matter, and that new project had no work for me to do. AND access to my previous project was removed. These people are extremely incompetent and ridiculous.

No one, and I mean NO ONE is honestly giving these incompetent scammers a 5-star rating. No one can honestly say this is a good company. They are LYING.

Edit: I will answer to the Outlier Team.

What happened to me has nothing to do with a project ending. The project I was working on had tasks. I was happily working on it. I was moved against my will to the new project, which by the time I started, was over. And my old project permanently disappeared from my dashboard. I wasn't removed from it by the project admin. Instead, Outlier blocked my access to it. I know because I am still in the Discord channel for it and I talked to the QM. He told me someone changed my ""expert"" tag when I was forced to move to the new project. I contacted support about it and nothing. I get copy-pasted bullshit responses irrelevant to my case. I have an EQ, but I shouldn't because a) I didn't get removed from a project and b) that project didn't end.",Most positive reviews are fake,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6785b3badf5605ce4c29ea45

In the beginning, I was making $40/hour doing relatively easy and enjoyable work ranking the responses of AI models, with generous ""missions: allowing me to earn a couple hundred dollars extra each month. A few months later, the pay was reduced to $35/hour, then more recently it was reduced again to $25/hour. On top of these unexplained pay cuts (support staff will say they have no control over our pay, and it seems like we can't get in touch with anyone who *does* have a say), the availability of work has declined, the unpaid trainings and quizzes have gotten longer and more difficult to pass, and it's gotten more difficult to get in touch with support staff. I'm not surprised that Outlier's parent company, Scale AI, is under two lawsuits right now for violating California labor law.

"I recently went through the Dutch test interview, and the entire process felt extremely intrusive and frustrating. They required an excessive amount of personal information: your ID, your face, your name, and even a 3D scan of your face before you could proceed with the interview. After all that, you had to record yourself talking about personal topics like your hobbies, vacations, and more. Then, you needed to transcribe everything they said and correct it to ensure it was perfect. The questions were very strange, especially when phrased in Dutch.

After all that effort, I was rejected. Honestly, I wasn’t necessarily expecting this, but I think the rejection was fair because they didn’t explain upfront what the process would entail. It felt like they just threw the test at you without any guidance, saying, “Here you go, make it.” There was no opportunity to mentally prepare for what was coming. On top of that, they imposed strict timers—2 minutes for writing tasks and 2 minutes 30 seconds for the recordings—which left no time to process or think.

The fact that you can’t even retake the test makes it even more frustrating. Overall, the experience felt rushed, unclear, and unnecessarily invasive.

"TLDR:
Working with Outlier is a great way for students or people with a job to flexibly make extra income! It is a good short-term option as a full-time position, but it is not a great long-term career option.

Pros:
- Very Flexible
- Good Pay (domain-dependent)
- Interesting and varied projects
Cons:
- No benefits (figuring it out yourself is time-consuming and expensive)
- Instruction/Communication/Management quality can vary a lot between projects
- You don't get a lot of say in what projects you are assigned to
- Little to no possibility for advancement or professional development
- No guarantee of long-term work availability

I've been working with Outlier for almost 10 months, and have really appreciated the flexible remote work. I work when I am free, can easily take breaks to look after my kids, and can take the work with me when I travel (allowing me to go on more family vacations). 

The compensation has been fairly competitive (I have a STEM PhD, so my pay scale is on the higher end of the spectrum) and they often offer great work bonuses (these are generally geared toward individuals working at least 20 hours a week). I've earned a good living this year, even considering the fact that the position doesn't come with benefits.

The big downside is that you can get bounced around between projects without warning, which can be disorienting. They recently added a feature where you can select a secondary project, but they will still shuffle you around based on project priorities. 

The projects I've worked on have been varied, and so has the quality of the project design and management. I've really enjoyed many, I've disliked a couple, and the rest have been middle of the road. Projects generally last from a few weeks to a few months.",Flexible Work and Good Compensation,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67658d1896b0e8be0d21ed94
"When work is consistent, this can be a good job. The problem is that you never know when your ability to earn an income will be shut off with no notice. The last few months have been a nightmare with hours being capped and projects getting paused, sometimes for an entire week, and right before Christmas when workers depend on a steady income more than ever! There is very little transparency with this company; they will make decisions that are life-changing for their workers yet leave them in the dark about what's going on. I often feel like a rat in a maze and am not treated like I'm a human being who depends on this income to survive. Your work is judged by people who have no idea what they're doing and you'll get penalized for it. Their platforms are a joke; they're the buggiest, most unusable interfaces I've ever had to deal with. On multiple occasions, I've had problems not receiving the pay I had earned, and it took more than a month to get the issue resolved. This COULD be a great company to work for. I love being able to work from home on my own schedule. Unfortunately, this company has had so many problems that I cannot recommend depending on them as your primary source of income.

the quality of this platform has gone downhill starting around September and it’s sad to see. I was a contributor back when the platform was run on Remotasks and this was such a great side gig to earn extra income until September when everything changed. I’m not sure if there was new management but the quality of Outlier has deteriorated to a point where I had to give this platform a 1/5 review. There are so many documented cases on the Outlier Reddit of project staff uploading severely inaccurate instruction documents that directly contradict the onboarding assessments that it appears they want you to fail. Maybe this is because they hired on too many contributors for the available projects but the decline is noticeable. ,the quality of this platform has gone downhill…,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6764764d0316205c4ab82b95
"First, let me say that this site is legitimate. You do actual work, training various types of AI models (including some being used in the real world, though specifics are both secretive and things you cannot post about publically) and actually get paid for it. It has been a nice side income because it is (mostly) very flexible. The pay is ok, but not always the best. Payment is prompt and weekly (either via PayPal for instant access, or through direct deposit, which can take an extra 1 or 2 days). 

Now here's the bad: you do not have much (any) control over a lot. You are paid like an independent contractor, but there is no contract. You can see pay increases based on projects which are often assigned based on past quality, but the program can also decide to change payrates. In the Spring, there was a massive shakeup and my pay rate was cut by 40%. There are missions, but these are often time dependent and take away a lot of that flexibility. Additionally, quality control is layered, with the first layer being other contributors with slightly more experience. Sometimes this leads to bad reviews that affect your quality score, which can impact whether you stay on a project as well as get placed onto new ones. There are also regular issues with ""Empty Queues (EQ)"". Because these projects are external client dependent, they can end, often with little warning, and then you have to find or be assigned to a new project. This can take time.

Bottom line: it is a good way to make some extra money, but I would never ""go full time"" and count on it for funds. It is just not stable nor reliable enough for that. When it's good, it's good, but when it's bad, it's horrendously terrible.",Mixed bag,3,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/676475dace8514452d786dbb

"Working for Outlier started slow. It really did. Getting matched and onboarded with my first project about a year ago was time-consuming and tedious. Training was often unpaid and sometimes in vain as I wasn't guaranteed to be matched with the project I was training for based on the quality of the assessment tasks I was given.

BUT! When I finally found a project that matched my skillset and expertise, I discovered that Outlier could be a fantastic source of income. This company compensates and rewards quality work. The opportunity to make significant money, have fun, and advance in various roles on different projects was a big plus. 

Outlier rewards quality work. There isn't much room for error, so you must be on your A-game when completing assessments during project onboarding, or you will not make it. Once assigned a project, you must maintain quality performance, or you may be moved off the project.

"At first, after a slightly convoluted onboarding, things seemed OK. There was a bit of work around, though it wasn't fabulous pay, it was better than nothing.
Lately, however, things seemed to have gone a bit awry. I had three successive pay cuts of which I was never informed of in advance. On some programs with Outlier, you find out the day after you work what rate you were working at. Various attempts to engage customer support led me to believe that the agent, Julie D, was a not-exactly-cutting-edge AI program. 'She' never answered the questions put to her and just regurgitated boilerplate policy.
Yesterday, after finally completing my Assessment Tasks for a project that was advertised as having 'plenty of work to take us to the end of December' the project was closed with a few hours notice. So bang goes next week's pay. The other project I am on was paused this time last week and has no work  on it.
It's a shame - the work is challenging and interesting enough to overcome some of the frustrations, but comms are terrible, nobody knows anything until it's too late and you are likely to be moved from one project to the next so fast, you may end up with whiplash.

"It's time to express some grievances. Up until now, I've been fortunate to be assigned to a semi-permanent project for the past two years, during which I earned pay raises and a promotion. However, last year around Christmas, we experienced a persistent ""EQ"" (empty queue), meaning no work was coming through. This resulted in significant layoffs and unexpected pay rate cuts, right before the holiday season. At that time, I was lucky enough not to be on the chopping block, but around 60% of the team was let go due to the lack of incoming work. Ironically, shortly after these layoffs, new hires joined the remaining team, despite those who were let go being told they'd have the opportunity to return if more work became available.

Fast forward to today, just two weeks before Christmas, and I guess my luck has run out. Despite being used as an example of good performance just the day before, I received the unfortunate news that I'd be moved off the project ""until more work returns."" I know they likely won’t make any effort to communicate future opportunities for reemployment, but I plan to check in frequently to avoid being forgotten.

"Hello everyone,

I have worked for Outlier for quite some time, on different projects, as an attempter, reviewer, and senior reviewer. In other words, I am not an employee with Outlier, but a simple contributor who enjoys being an independent contractor. On that note, I enjoy the flexibility Outlier offers. Also, I enjoy the pay they offer as well as the ability to make bonus money through missions (I made $1400 just last week, just in time for Christmas!). The one potential negative is support but to be honest, I rarely have need of support. I get my pay on time, rarely have technical issues that are not immediately addressed, and always receive the total pay I have earned. Actually, the last time I emailed support was 3 months ago, and it had to do with the new addition of the marketplace (which is an awesome addition) that was randomly removed, but I came to find out it was in a trial phase. Nevertheless, I rarely have issues with Outlier, the projects are fun and challenging, the QMs are awesome and on point, and to be honest, most of the complaints I have heard are from people who have tried to game the system (i.e., low effort or using AI, which is a big no-no) to get quick cash and get kicked from the platform. To sum this up, it is not a scam and I always get paid (and sometimes it's a big paycheck)!  ",Great company/Great pay,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67592730f33e3db44ed29b46

"I can speak from my own experiences. I transitioned from another platform to Outlier about a year ago, and my experience has been positive. I'll squash a rumor now, which is that I’ve never had to worry about getting paid. My payments have always been reliable and on time. Additionally, the notion that Outlier is out to steal personal information is completely unfounded.
That said, I believe there’s room for improvement, particularly in the process of addressing contributors being unfairly removed from projects or banned from the platform without clear reasons. They get a notice on their dashboard to send an email to a certain email address where they are responded to by an automated system, 'Robot Ricardo.' No one even read the email that they were told to send. It takes away a person's voice, and that sets off a toxic, negative chain of events from the CB, and that's how rumors get started. I know if my voice was taken away and I, God forbid, lost my acct and the ability to defend myself, I'd be livid. I know that some individuals exploit the system, but no two people are the same. Everyone deserves a fair shot and should never be accused of doing something without being given a reason and a voice.
I remind myself that as an independent contractor, steady work isn’t guaranteed. I am very grateful for the opportunity. I learn something new every day, and there isn't anywhere else I've worked where I can say that. Working through the platform, I've been able to give myself a better life. I have been able to pay my bills, buy two cars, put food on my table, and keep a roof over my head, and I'll be grateful for that forever. I love the work that I do on the platform. They even provide webinars during the week and pay you to attend so you can improve the quality of your tasks. In my opinion, that's pretty awesome! I could not be happier.

"I personally have had a very great experience with Outlier. I started when it was Remotasks and have been working for them for years. I almost consistently have work, but I understand that is not everyone's experience. It is a gig job so there are no guaranteed hours and you need to be willing to accept that fact if you apply. There are times where there is no work or you might have training after training. I definitely recommend this for a secondary job, and when you get work, take advantage of it. Provide good work, and they'll give you projects. There are many people on the platform, so lack of work is inevitable, but there are many like me who could work 40 hours every week if they wanted with very few periods without work. It's definitely luck of the draw at first, but over time you can get yourself into a good place with consistent work most of the time. I know many say it's a scam, but it's not. Gig work is just hard to actually get work sometimes. Every site I know of has the same issue with this.  You just need to be persistent in checking for work and providing good work when it's available. They need to see that you are a quality worker before they trust you too much. Their reputation is on the line with the work we provide, as it's going to their clients. I know my review is probably different than most, but I genuinely love working for Outlier. I am so grateful for the job and understand that I'm 'one of the lucky ones' but it could happen to you too! Just don't go into it expecting tons of hours at first and keep this as a second job, at least until you get established on the platform.

"After 18 months of working with Remotasks the project transitioned to the Outlier platform opening the door to a host of issues. The issues began with Empty Queue, followed by a missing Marketplace program. When each of these issues were reported, some slight change was made, until a message appeared stating that I should log onto an alternative Outlier account. As I’d had no other account, I reported the issue and racked my brain for the cause of this issue.

Outlier/Remotasks utilized SLACK. During the transition to Outlier, takers were advised that communications would also transition to Discourse. In closing that platform and changing the monikers of all its support staff, the company eliminated all their support records. As class action suits are being pursued this would make sense, especially since their Zen desk record histories were also being hidden from account services. 

I saved the record numbers and was careful to list them when I raised these issues. Despite my efforts, I was accused of violating “community rules” dating back to December 2022 when their admin Gladys asked me to create a new account upon terminating their contract with Upwork. Those notes are contained within SLACK, with references in Zen Desk. 

Outlier.ai is a disjointed and disorganized place to work. Be wary of dismissal when it’s convenient for them! And don’t bother to save records, as they arrogantly feign omniscience. After leveling this accusation, Braxton informed me that my case would not be appealed.

"Time spent learning about a project is unpaid, time spent being assessed (on whether you've learned the necessary material) is poorly paid. 

This wouldn't be terrible if you got to be on a project for a reasonable length of time, or knew how long you would be on a project so you could judge whether to bother spending the time working unpaid. 

But no, that's not what happens. 

As an example, I was put on a new project a couple of days ago. This morning, I was moved to a new project and the unpaid time starts all over again. As this is a side job, I wouldn't have had time to do more than a couple of hours of properly paid work in the mean time. Thank goodness I didn't bother. 

Outlier are up front about what they pay but the constant switching (or lack of work on some projects) really puts me off bothering to learn the material in the first place. If every hour of work that is well paid requires half an hour of unpaid work, the rate is no longer so brilliant.

Dann muss man schlussendlich auch berücksichtigen, dass ein Dollar weniger wert ist als ein Euro … Versteuern muss man das Einkommen dann je nach Situation ggf. auch noch.

"My comment only deals with the onboarding experience. I have not yet progressed beyond that point, as it only happened yesterday. I was drawn into the process by the ease with which the automated process moved seamlessly from one point to the next. My ID was processed with my live picture added, within minutes.

Having seen the other scathing reviews from the review platform, I am left with the suspicion that perhaps the lack of skills in navigating things technical, could be responsible for the frustrations. Having been new at ICT tools myself in the past, and even now, I am still a user at best (not technical at all), I can relate to the frustration. 

Sometimes techno-savvy people cannot understand what frustrates a novice in ICT tools. There is a common sense feeling about the use of computers that grows into the subconscious mind, with no need to be taught, after much usage. But it takes a few entrance barriers, in the beginning. After that, one learns to follow almost by instinct. 

It must feel like a toddler learning to walk, climb and run. after a few falls, the subconscious refers to past experiences and extrapolates them into what the toddler has not even as yet experienced, to navigate novel challenges. and in all that time, the mind continues to learn de novo when encountering unchartered terrain.

I would then say, to fellow users and entrants, let us hang in there and learn from the previous glitches, if any, and grow our embedded incremental learning as it grows subconsciously. Like in learning to walk as babies, one day we will run without even trying. If a 69-year-old like me can navigate and onboard in less than an hour, in such a hi-tech environment, when I am a ""no-tech"" professional lawyer, then anybody else can.

"First, it's not a scam. You can make real money doing real work that is engaging and fun. But, here is how it works, for me and for many:

You spend a few hours onboarding. Then you wait months for work. Then you get work. You make a little money. Then that work disappears without warning or explanation. Then more work comes, and you work on a project for a week. Then it disappears without warning or explanation. Then you get another, and it does not disappear for a while. You get promoted. That work then suddenly disappears without warning or explanation. Then another project pops up. Yay. This project is easy and straightforward compared to the previous one, which led to a promotion. Then you get flagged for ""low quality work"" without explanation and are removed from the project. Then two weeks later you get the opportunity to onboard for new projects. You attempt to onboard for two, spending a few hours doing so. Once your onboarding is complete, there are no tasks available to you...And you don't get paid for the time you spent...

Can you make money? Sure. Is it worth your time? You decide...",Can make money. Can lose lots of time and patience and dignity.,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/673f9c7dd06b527944a2deb0

"Personally, my experience working for Outlier (previously Remotask) has had its pros and cons.

First off, no, it is NOT A SCAM. It's a legitimate side hustle that you can participate in and can provide you extra money on the side. I've been working on the site for a little over a year and I've been paid on time through Paypal. Pay can differ depending on the project you get placed on; it'll typically say how much you'll earn per hour so like $15/hr or $18/hr or higher. Don't get butthurt when you can't pass the assessment into a project with higher pay because those tend to look into specific areas of expertise (therefore higher expectations).

Projects can be hard to secure depending on your area of expertise (writing, STEM, foreign language, etc.), and passing assessments can be tricky, so take notes and do not just wing your assessments. Read through the project documents and make sure you understand what they're looking for. ALWAYS TAKE NOTES!!

The site, projects, and interface are constantly changing so navigation can be confusing. However, as long as you keep an open-mind to learning and do NOT rely on this as a stable job, you'll do great. REPEAT, NOT A STABLE JOB.


The support on Outlier is a mixed bag. There are times when I get helpful feedback and other times when I don't, which can be extremely frustrating. Additionally, there will be times when your TMs or QMs can't provide you with more information on so and so because they do not have enough details on the project yet so DO NOT get upset when they can't disclose any more than they actually have.

Things to consider:
- NOT A SCAM!
- NOT A STABLE JOB, so do not treat it like one.
- Keep an open-mind to learning and understand the outline of whatever project you're working on.
- File support tickets when you have issues and communicate with your project's team.
- Write/take notes.","Legitimate job opportunity, but not stable...",3,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/673d2c4e880552fc30aff1b6

"I don't know where to begin writing this. I've been a member for 2 years. I was recently contacted by someone higher up on the platform asking me to write a review saying that ""Outlier was not a scam and that they actually pay."" and the person who wrote the email actually also went on to provide the reasons that they were asking for the review stating that they were 'reading disinformation online and that people were claiming that Outlier is actually a scheme to steal people's personal data. This would almost be funny if potential contributors weren't scared off by such outlandish statements so I'm reaching out to folks like you who have (I hope) had a positive experience in order to present a realistic picture specifically we want people to know that Outlier is not a scam when you work on the platform you get paid."" ...OHH I carefully considered the requests in the email and the email also requested for me to paint a 'realistic picture' of the platform. So I'm going to do just that so buckle up!

I started out on their other platform called Remotasks and if any one knows what that is, that means you know I've been around for a long time. I was mitigated to the Outlier platform along with countless other people and I wish it never would have happened. 
At first, It thought I had finally found my dream job, I was getting paid so well for the first time in my entire life I never had to worry about paying my bills. Things went bad quickly and I literally would have a list as long as my arm of all the horrible things that have been done to me. The person that wrote and requested the review must be living in some kind of fantasy land. I also receive a survey every month but they're more worried about the user interface instead of doing the right thing and treating people with respect. Once, I was actually accused of milking the clock I was so alarmed by that, no pun intended, that it made me physically sick because I have no reason to do such a thing and I was never raised that way. It's against what I believe in and I work my butt off on that platform and what they did in return is I tried to log in and when I got logged in there was a bar across my screen on my dashboard telling me that my account was disabled. I would have to write to accounts@Outlier(dpt)Ai with some type of justification of why I did what I did within 2 weeks, when I didn't do anything to begin with. I immediately wrote the email address on my dashboard though! I had to write this justification for something I never did and within two minutes I received a response from 'Robot Ricardo' telling me they just now reviewed my account& I would not get my account back so they disabled me for something that I never did it was disgusting. (They didn't review it.) However, something else had happened and I cannot say too much of what but some one higher up than the moron that disabled my account was wrong & I got my account back. Every 3 months, be prepared for a '3 month purge' they must have an AI just drawing random worker ID numbers out of a hat and disabling and banning people for no reason every three months this happens I have been through it about eight times in two years you're either booted from a project or banned from the platform like clockwork they think people are disposable and they just think people are going to keep coming. smh the nerve in this email really got me 'new contributors to be scared off with outlandish statements.' They should be really scared and they should run away from ever dreaming to do something like this it is mental abuse when you go to open up a course or test knowing if you miss one answer you get kicked out of a project but when you open it one of the test questions is always wrong every time in two years so you have no choice but to give the wrong answer on a multiple choice knowing the whole time you're getting kicked out because of somebody else's screw up. They call high quality worklow quality as a reason to kick you out too I know people that's been on boarding for months and have never been off. to be able to work 60 hours a week if I wanted but last week my hubstaff was capped at 2 hours for no freaking reason. After being Pool 2 And a reviewer they put me back into a newbie stage when I have a 4.8 rating out of 5. But I will agree with one thing the email said and that is the only thing I've never had a problem receiving my payment that's the only thing I will agree with anything else be prepared to have your heart ripped out on subjectiveness be accused of being a time thief while they are shafting you they're asking you to write a review instead of taking care of people the way that they should they disparage you and then they ask you to write a realistic review what a joke.

The procedures and policies are much smoother, but there is still a huge room for improvement. They would benefit from a lot more transparency and communication. Many contributors have left because of the lack of both. Not only are the pay rates decent, but they often offer bonuses for certain projects where you can earn extra income. I have worked as a contributor, reviewer, and team lead.

I have really enjoyed my time working with them, and I hope it will continue to improve. I have stayed despite the chaos because most projects are enjoyable and challenging and a good source of extra income.

Pros - Impacting a new generation of technology, interesting topics at times, great QMs, community to engage with, good pay when not adjusted randomly without notice, flexible work schedule, ability to work as many hours as you want if work is available. 

Cons - 
Changing pay rates without notice - we were notified that pay would be based on the project and we would have a pay card and a choice to accept the project or decline, and that has not happened. My pay rate was the same for the last 6 months and then suddenly dropped by $10/hour without notice, when a  few days before the pay cut I was sent an email about what a great job I was doing expressing and an invitation to interview to be a quality auditor.  

Training tasks or benchmarks that have errors (frequently).

The platforms can be glitchy. 

Customers can pause or stop projects at any time and you are moved as often as needed to fill the need for contributors on projects.

"Working for outlier is a great opportunity! I have become an AI power user through their work. As a college student it’s a great way to turn random information into prompts. Use my fact checking skills, and elevate my writing proficiency. Working with AI gives a really fulfilling experience, the only down side is you might start talking and writing like you’re talking to an AI hahaha. 

Overall, if you have en expertise, you’re a college student, or you have ambition to sit behind a screen for many hours while at home and make money. Which yes, we get paid weekly through our PayPal or through direct deposit. It was all super simple to set up, and their identity verification process is non invasive. 

Overall I’ve had an amazing experience with outlier. Their QMs get back in a timely manner, and their support team has always gotten back to me.

"To begin, Outlier is 100% a legitimate company. You work, you get paid. I have been working for them since April 2024 and have received three promotions. Everything they advertise on their website is true. The work and pay are completely legit.

After signing up and submitting your application, if you become hired, you will be assigned to a project. Once assigned, this will show up in your dashboard, where you must complete an onboarding process which includes paid training, a short test, and an onboarding interview that takes about 20 minutes where they ask questions about your relevant work experience, education, how many hours you can expect to work per week, and your role expectations. Once completed, you're hired (unless something came up in the interview that would change this), and they provide you with everything you need to task on the platform including documents, instructions, and resources for communication and time tracking for pay.

For tasking on the platform itself, some projects are paid by task and others are paid by the hour. In all my months working here, all my pay has been on time and correct. While some of my co-workers have occasionally encountered pay issues, these have always been resolved within a few days or a week following communication with any of the managers or with Outlier support.

You can begin and end tasking whenever you want, meaning you can work part or full-time, that is entirely up to you, and you will be paid for the time you spend working. This includes partial hourly pay as well for the hourly pay folks. For example, say your hourly pay is $20, if you work for 30 minutes, you will be paid $10. You have the option to receive payment through direct deposit or PayPal.

The workflow is extremely organized and professional. Communication is constant and imperative, and the managers will always guide you on updated tasking guidelines, expectations, and project updates. You also have access to the entire community of taskers in your project and role so you can ask questions or discuss anything work-related. The managers and community are some of the most professional and respectful people I have worked with.

I have taken this seriously since day one, and for me, this is a dream job for several reasons: You get unrivaled world-life flexibility with the ability to work whenever you want and for as long as you want (as long as you meet your role’s weekly hourly minimum), you get to work from home or from anywhere with an internet connection, and you can travel whenever you want.

The only thing regarding travel is this, you must stay within the country you were initially hired in because if you log into Outlier from outside that country, your account will be flagged and potentially disabled since they will think someone is trying to hack into your account. If this does happen, you can just submit a request ticket and you should be able to recover your account, but do beware of this. If you plan on traveling within the country, all you will have to do is submit a travel indicator on your dashboard so that the platform knows you will be logging in from a different location so it won’t flag your account for a potential break-in attempt.

In conclusion, this is 100% legitimate work and pay, the details on their website and in the job listings are completely true, and you get a ton of perks doing this type of work (work-life flexibility, remote work, travel potential, and honest and consistent pay).",Outlier Review From an Experienced Tasker,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6735051f61e070be1f0561b1
"I have worked on projects for almost a year in total. Early on in the project, my pay rate was cut unexpected, but fixed and back paid. However, about halfway into the year, my pay rate was cut 20% from the agreed rate (without notice or reason)- this time it was permanent. Although my rate was lower, and the regular bonuses based on hours produced (up to an extra $160 per day) were cut, I kept working and believing that things would resolve. 

This was a mistake. I was promoted to reviewer and then a candidate for the ideal response BootCamp during the first phase of audio-to-text. Once in the BootCamp, the company changed from slack to discourse, which completely removed direct communication lines to 'team leads'. I spent the past 3 months posting on the daily issues threads and NO ONE ever responds about my issues or concerns. The parent company (Scale AI) founder severely needs to get back to 'startup mode mindset' and listen to concerns over this company, instead of counting his mezzanine pre-ipo money.

The only problem I have had so far is being removed from a project quickly as soon as I get some bad feedback. This should be the case, but the bad reviews come from incompetent reviewers. I saw this lately in mm_math-frappucino project. The same task is rated as 2 and rejected, and submitted the same, got 5 second time as per the outlier forum. In my case, for a minor mistake, the reviewers could fix the typo (less than 1 minute of work), assign a grade of 3, and move forward with the task, but they assign 2 and SBQ.

"Outlier is one big headache. It's not a scam, but in some ways it's worse. They do pay, but sometimes not the right amount. You'll be promised a certain amount for training that won't materialize until you complain loudly and steadily enough about what you're owed. Also, just when you start to get steady work on their platform, you'll suddenly find yourself dealing with glitchy tasks that might time-out in the middle of your work, meaning that all the work you've put in you won't get paid for. Then, as the tasks begin to dry up, you'll be asked to take an hourly pay cut. Worse, after steady work you've come to depend on, all your work will go away and you'll be faced with an empty queue for months. You'll start wondering if it's the quality of your own work, but then realize it couldn't be that, because your reviews had been so high and you'd actually been interviewed for a promotion. In my case, nothing was communicated clearly, my team lead was suddenly laid off, the slack channel went away overnight, and all of my good work reviews were deleted, and then replaced with the ONE bad review I got based on an honest mistake around unclear task instructions. Also, I had a reviewer make easily verifiable mistakes in reviewing my work, but I was penalized for their mistake. Then, I was ghosted for months - and had an empty queue the entire time. Reaching out to support got zero results, and I was told to just be patient. Out of the blue, Outlier invited me back to work urgently, randomly, one late evening, and I logged in, spending more than two hours training for two separate projects for no pay, only to find the work dried up immediately after I finished the training and my queue was once again empty. Then, shockingly, they emailed me and suggested I post a review on this platform. Well, here's the review. If you like a whole lot of frustration for very little return, work for Outlier. If you want to be stressed about when you might get another task, or whether you've been ghosted because all your good work wasn't appreciated, then Outlier is for you. Otherwise, I'd steer clear.

"Despite earning nearly $40k in under a year, I think the time you'd invest in Outlier would be better directed toward finding a reliable job with a real company that will allow you to learn, develop, and grow.

The issue with Outlier is that it's entirely unpredictable and thus, extremely unreliable as a source of income.

One minute you'll have work, and the next, you'll be placed on the sideline, waiting and wondering if it's worth sticking around (it's probably not).

If you're uncomfortable with sudden and unexpected change, Outlier is not for you.

Once you've settled into a project, they'll pause it for an unspecified amount of time, leaving you without work, or forcing you to switch and adapt to a new project. You won't be paid for training and onboarding, either. It's a total waste of time.

The autonomy is awesome. Easily the greatest benefit. Come and go as you please, so long as your projects aren't paused.

You can't and should never put all your eggs in this basket, but if you're looking for a side hustle to earn extra income, it's a decent way to earn money. Many of us make $800-$1,000+ per week while there's work. Just make sure you never end up relying on Outlier.

Positives: 
-You do get paid and you get paid weekly. There have been a few times that I didn't get paid for a webinar or bonus work, but the customer service was incredibly helpful. They let me know that it would be on the next pay cycle, and it was. 
-The amount of hours you work is up to you. I usually average about 18-20 hours a week and I could have chosen to work more. There are times that work is not available (more about that in the negatives).
- The platform has a community section that is incredibly helpful especially when tasks are paused. 

Negatives:
- Inconsistency with the workload. One minute you are just working away, and then the next thing you know you don't have any tasks available for 3-5 days. If you are working on Outlier for supplemental income this might not be a big negative but when it is your main source of income, it is incredibly stressful. 
- The reviewers are super inconsistent which is stressful because bad reviews can lead to getting kicked off of a project.

"My experience with Outlier so far has been pretty smooth. Many different projects come and go, and there seem to be plenty of projects to keep us busy.

"TLDR: The work is not easy. Outlier expects high-quality work but rewards it well. I continue to see poor reviews of Outlier and have not experienced any of the commonly cited issues: scams, no projects, back pay, etc. 

Starting Up - The onboarding process from submitting my application to starting my first project was unusual. Outlier tests applicants as a form of interview which was, in my experience, better than all of the time-wasting, multi-round interviews other companies make you go through. It took some time to complete this, about two weeks, but then I was off into their system and started my first project. 

Training - Preparing you for work is done through learning modules. You must be extremely keen on the details of what is expected to succeed in the projects. The thing about all the projects is they are very specific as to what they are requesting team members to do and there is a lot of information that team members need to keep in mind when tasking. You have to be quick to learn and be able to parse through pages and pages of documentation on what is expected of projects. My theory is there are a lot of people who are being kicked off of projects for breaking rules or submitting poor quality work and then leaving poor reviews for Outlier. I can't confirm this and it is just a hunch. 

Projects - The tasks for projects entail working with AI assistants/models to test, benchmark, and improve their capabilities. Each team member must follow the instructions to the exact specifications so that the project can perform what it is trying to accomplish. Note that most if not all work is reviewed by other users and even QCed by management to ensure quality. You can not get away with bad work and if you are complacent enough, you will be removed. 

Payments - I have only experienced a few payment issues and the support team was able to easily remedy the situation. I am not sure why people say this is a scam and that they do not pay people, but I have been working a lot and received $9000 with no issues.",Misconceptions - From the view of a happy user,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672fded8c32f9ffac23076a4

"I debated writing this as I have had such a complicated experience with this company, but I believe that it is important to understand the issues as we move into a world where more people will be doing contract work, and AI will be moving into more spaces.

There are definite pros and cons to working with Outlier AI, but I don't believe false information helps anyone, so bear with me.

Pros:
* The tasks (when they are available) are diverse and interesting. Some are fun and creative. Many are challenging.
* The money can (at times) be good.
*I love the flexibility of working when I want to.

Cons:
*I started at a higher hourly rate and bonuses were easy to get. Now, the hourly rate is lower and they have random time limits. If you go over them, you get the choice of not submitting (which means hours of wasted work) or submitting for a lower rate (which to me is a form of wage theft). The bonuses are often only achieved if you work many hours.
* There are many onboarding and training moments with no pay.
* They use time limits because they think workers will procrastinate and waste time for more money. This is the key issue: they treat their contract workers as untrustworthy.
* I believe they've brought on too many contractors, which means that work runs out quickly and workers come and go. This pushes against their quality expectations. Fewer workers with good quality would be better than angry and frustrated workers.

Ultimately, this comes down to being so excited about the technology that they forget that there are humans behind the work. They rely on their technology to assign projects, give feedback, etc. but that does not translate when dealing with issues of human interactions, people's time, and the hard work people put into their job. There is very little human-to-human communication. The training tells you what to do, but if you make mistakes, half the time you are removed from a task without any explanation. 
Sometimes it feels as if they are training us to respond more as an AI model would, rather than us training AI to sound more human. In a way, that is a comfort, as it proves to me that AI will not be able to fully replace human interaction, but any AI company will struggle unless it figures out how to balance human worker needs and the new technology. I believe the company has potential, but it needs to rethink how the human part of the business functions.

"I started working with Outlier when they were just starting up the Bulba Experts project. (.... SIDE NOTE: The only two stars of this review are for the Bulba Experts project, which is now over.) That was the only project I partook in where I felt like the team leaders treated me like a human being and I received adequate pay.

After that, it was a kafkaesque nightmare where you read 70 page instruction documents, join a project for a week (at less than the pay you were hired for), it ends, or you get removed by a terrible reviewer, rinse and repeat.

Let's be honest about something - if you know *anything* about AI, its that there is so, so, so much money in it. In the old days of data labeling, like on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, the low wages were justified, as many of these jobs were small research teams needing labor.

"I've been working for Outlier for about 9 months, and to be honest, there's really nothing bad to say about the company. I was promoted quickly from a Tier 3 to a Tier 2 contributor, and that came with a generous bump in pay and now I'm under consideration for a full-time position with them. Do they pay? Yes. And sometimes you even get as much as $70/hour if you have multiple ""mission"" bonuses. The downside is missions don't happen all the time and sometimes the work is very scant too, and you'll find yourself testing for and onboarding with a slew of new projects only to see them go on hiatus and new ones start up. Also, depending on the project, some tasks end exactly at a set time and if you don't get it done by then you won't get paid for it, and there is also an issue with some reviewers being nitpicky unnecessarily and some course module quizzes being poorly written causing taskers to be pulled off of projects by the automated system and not being put back on. Customer service is perhaps the worst because if you try to get through to them, they just send you canned answers and there isn't as yet a way to appeal bad reviewer and quiz scores. That said, on the whole they are pretty fair and do give you a chance to make some fast extra cash while doing something very interesting. Also, they recently rolled out a 'marketplace' feature that still has some bugs but has done a lot the past two months to make the work with them steadier. Don't get me wrong, it's not like being a tasker or expert is something I would suggest quitting your day job for. It's not that steady and it's not meant to be. Also, the starting hourly is about what minimum wage is in a major city, so that's a bad side of it, but on the other hand, they promote quickly, so that's not terrible, and since it's remote, this is only an issue if you aren't willing to move somewhere more rural (I would if it weren't for my son wanting to stay where we are). Anyhow, if you have other irons in the fire and want to learn how AI is developing from the inside as part of that process (you work with a LOT of the biggest names) while making a quick extra buck, Outlier is a perfect fit.

"Update To Review (12-12-24), 2 Stars, down from 4 Stars: 
A few months ago, Outlier would compensate you if a task expired on you due to the timer/deadline running out. At some point, they stopped doing this but no one was notified of this change. What did that mean? Several people, believing they were familiar with the pay policy, contacted support and were met with essentially ""we don't pay for expired tasks."" This is a disgusting business practice of lack of transparency or properly informing persons of updates to your policies. No emails were sent about this, no notifications, nothing. Who knows what else they will change without notice? They may be changing something right now as I type this.

Another issue regarded a project where the AI model or project was not loading properly. The first step of each task involved getting a reference text and making a prompt which aims to make the AI make a mistake. Then, you'd enter your information and start generating responses. Now, if you notice that the AI isn't loading once you try to generate responses, the managers (""queue managers/QMs"") said you should skip the task (not ideal because this means that all the time you spent before that point is now paid $0. Anyways, if you managed to get the AI to load in step 1 and get to subsequent steps and it stops working then, what are you supposed to do? Apparently some people get a message telling them that they can exit the task and be paid for their time while other people receive no such message (Outlier has 0 transparency on what conditions generate this message.) Short of getting this message, what are you expected to do? Skip the task and get paid $0 for the time you spent up to that point. Yes, even if you spent 10+ minutes researching, critiquing the AI etc., if the task stops working, you are expected to skip and get $0. Even if you report a ""platform error"" when forced to skip you are paid $0. This is not how moral business is run. Whether the task was actually submitted is not the only factor to determine whether someone should be paid. If they spend their time (their labor) on a task and it stops working due to your platform's fault, not theirs, they should be paid because they did work. That's what people are paid for: work. Overall, my opinion of Outlier is deteriorating rapidly. I used to really like the platform but now, they're starting to seem more shady and unjust the longer I work with them. Support also used to take long to reply sometimes before (emphasis on sometimes) but now 95% of my emails go unanswered. It's as if the company is getting worse with time instead of better, the opposite of what should be happening. Companies should improve with time, not deteriorate. Honestly, the way things are going, I am honestly not very optimistic about Outlier's future because having poor support and lack of transparency inevitably leads to poor reviews (of which there is no shortage I am aware), lack of morale from workers and overall bad reputation. Outlier needs to get its act together. Hopefully reviews like this will help inspire improvements.

Original Review (11-07-24), 4 Stars: Honestly, Outlier is a great opportunity to work remotely. I started earlier this year maybe around March or April. When work is consistent it's very good but sometimes there isn't work available and you have to wait a bit. Also, some of the bonuses/missions are really great.

I gave a 4 instead of a 5 because sometimes support takes a really long time to reply but overall, my experience has been positive. Apparently, some people have called it a scam but it certainly is not, at least for me. I actually do work and get paid for it each week when I do. If a task expires or some error happens, I have always received my rightful pay by contacting support with the details. I just had to wait a short time: 1 week, 2 weeks max, for it to process. 

One thing I hope they improve on is the amount of control you have over which projects you want to work on. Some projects are prioritized and get stuck on your dashboard even if you'd rather work on other stuff.",No Transparency On Pay,2,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672ea3e1ec1eae7cd967f990

"I am not sure where all the negative experiences are coming from as I am just a contributor and not on a lead level. I was searching for a job that I could do on my own time and make my own schedule without an interference with management. If that is what you are looking for this might be an option for you. I am always paid on time, I get my pay through PayPal and it usually hits Weds at midnight. I have been with the company since February of 2024 and have not had a pay issue for the hours I worked the previous week. Depending on the project you are assigned to, managers seem to be quite helpful. However, since there are a lot of contributors on projects, I feel the managers help could be increased as some important questions do go missed. I will say that there is not a lot of heads up when things change so there can be surprises often and you will need to adjust to the project changes very rapidly. If this is something that would be hard to adjust to, I would think this isn't for you. The communication between contributors is super kind and helpful and that makes the work easier. If you're looking for a do as you please, extra cash when you need it, type of deal this is for you. Also, it is a lot of reading, writing, correcting, and comprehension. If this is not something that would  interest you or be difficult, this is not the type of freelance job you should be looking for. I enjoy this type of work, and overall have had a good experience so far, with some minor things that have interrupted the work flow. They also run bonus missions for extra pay and that helps a lot!

I've had a great experience contributing to Outlier.ai. The platform offers increasingly high-paying gigs, which has been a huge plus for me. While the onboarding process before each project takes a bit of time, I understand it's essential to maintain the quality that Outlier is known for, and it helps ensure that everyone is fully prepared to succeed. It would be fantastic if we could be compensated for onboarding time after successfully completing the process, but overall, the setup is fair and transparent.

I also appreciate the recent addition of the marketplace, which makes finding new work opportunities much more convenient.

There are also many projects available.

After speaking with Outlier about this, they said since I had changed my payment method I would have to wait until the next pay cycle to receive payment. They went ahead and direct deposited it the next day despite their policy! I think people need to realize that this is not a full time job. You do not need to rely on this to pay all of your bills. It sure does come in handy for any extra expenses. There is definitely constant work. They have missions where they will pay you extra money just for tasking! There is constant support and resources.

"I have worked for Outlier intermittently for about 14 months and have earned over $30,000. Since I am an experienced full-time freelancer, I do not treat any client like a full-time job. That is an important part of working for this type of company.

Like most remote-first startups with an international workforce, there are hiccups. Projects and their rules change rapidly, so you must be able to take in new information, accept feedback, and adapt quickly. Pay also changes from project to project, so you may end up working for a different amount than you were originally hired for. I have experienced both higher and lower pay when switching projects. Sometimes, there are pay delays because that is a common issue with third-party payment processing that can happen at any time. But for me, it hasn't been often. 

Teams and their leaders also change frequently, so they have restructured how you communicate and get support several times over the course of me working for them. For a lot of people, these types of issues are frustrating, and you can suddenly be booted from a project if your quality ratings suffer too much.

Some great things about Outlier is that the company does pay consistently and you can choose how many hours you want to work. However, if you're consistently below 20 hours for several weeks, they may ask if there's any issues or remove you from a project. The company offers bonuses and missions from time to time that can be motivating and add to the pay. 

The projects are often fun and interesting depending on what you like to do. Overall, if you're flexible, independent, patient, and a fast learner, you can do well here. There are lots of trainings, but I have always been paid for them. When I first started, there was a delay in getting paid for the first training, but any additional trainings after that were paid with the regularly weekly earnings.

Overall, the platform is best for people who are able to interpret a lot of new information efficiently and do not solely depend on this work as a primary source of income.

"I have been working for Outlier since May 2024. Actually, it's like working for yourself. I'm a stay-at-home mom of two and I really needed some extra income to make ends meet. I searched for 6 months for a job that I could login from home, on my own time, and finally found Outlier. I work whenever my kids are playing by themselves, sleeping, or if I have down time. I love how I can login to work whenever, even when I can't sleep at 1 in the morning. The pay is very reasonable, and they give missions if you consistently have good reviews, which are like bonuses if you meet a certain deadline. I'll admit, it's not ""easy"" work, you have to have half a brain to pass assessments and get good reviews. You also have to be focused and not distracted when you work. The pay on projects ranges anywhere from 15-30$/hour for me so far. Each project is a bit different, and you can go back and forth, so you're not doing the same thing over and over again. Overall, I love working for Outlier, I have referred 4 of my friends, my sister, and even another stay-at-home mom I met at a playground. I wish more people knew about this job, but then again, I don't because I want all the work myself. Ha-ha. 


I wanted to add that Outlier has always been very clear that this job is not supposed to be a main source of income, it is supposed to be supplemental. Yes, you can get booted off of projects if you do bad or if there are no projects available, but personally, I always have had multiple backup projects. 

Also, many people complain because they take the training (which is unpaid) and then don't pass the assessments. You need to be a really good writer and speaker of your native language to succeed, as well as studying during training. You can't just breeze over it and expect to get a job like this. 

I am so happy I found this job. ",Great for a stay-at-home mom like me,5,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672d77217a5d55a899b3d65f
"I started working for Outlier in early 2024 after passing the initial assessment. When assigned to the first project, I read many reviews online and was concerned about people saying they weren't getting paid. After some contemplation, I decided to give it a try anyway. I am so glad that I did. The projects are exciting and challenging, and I love that the schedule is entirely flexible, so I can work when I want. Outlier pays me the correct amount on time each week. The work we do is for a variety of clients and furthers the development of AI.

So, why the negative reviews? First, the assessments are challenging, and not everyone will pass. Those who do not pass may feel frustrated. Some negative reviews stem from applicants thinking compensation is given for the assessments, but it is not. These interactive job interviews determine your eligibility to work for Outlier. These assessments are how Outlier ensures quality workers for their clients and determines the appropriate level to place each worker.

Once onboarded, your level will determine which projects you're eligible to work on. Each requires training, much of which is not compensated. Outlier is transparent about which tasks compensation applies to upfront. Training is more like a job benefit. Outlier helps build your knowledge and skills so you can earn money from completing project tasks. Many who post negative reviews incorrectly expect payment for all training. Compensation is given for some training elements, but not all.

After working with Outlier for several months, my skills and critical thinking have improved, and I enjoy regular, accurate pay each week. They provide a supportive community for project team members to collaborate, offer webinars for hands-on learning, and provide a flexible way to earn money.

"They asked me to give an honest review, so I figured why not. I don't get paid extra for it, but I consider this a public service for anyone else who considers working with this company.

First off, it IS real. It isn't a scam. You do, in fact, have the opportunity to earn $50/hr by spending up to an hour either performing or reviewing tasks for training a variety of different A.I. models. There are also ""missions"" that give you bonus pay if you finish a certain number of tasks or work for a certain amount of time. I personally made $4000 in a week through these missions. However, this wasn't normal for me, and I usually make more like a few hundreds dollars a week.

Second, and this is the important part, you are a contractor. You are not guaranteed work. That $4000 I made was after 4 months of making basically nothing because I wasn't placed on any projects or my task queue was empty (this is called EQ). If you look at the official forums, you constantly see people trying to contact their supervisors about being EQ for long periods of time with no response. 

Third, you have very little control over what projects you work on. Recently they added a ""marketplace"" that lets you sign up for new projects on your own. However, it is totally possible for you to randomly be assigned to a completely different project while your old project is made unavailable. For example, I earned that $4000 working on a single project, but then I was suddenly assigned to work on another project. While technically I was assigned to both projects, my new project was ""prioritized"", so I couldn't work on the old one. After learning from scratch how to work on the new project and getting into a new workflow, I was then assigned to a THIRD project. This one required expertise I don't have, so I couldn't do any work on it. I had to put in a request to be removed. I have since been placed on yet another project and have been unable to work on my original project for weeks. I still get emails about old projects that I asked to be removed from. This is why I am giving it 3 stars instead of 5. Lack of communication and constant project shuffling with little care put into whether I actually have the expertise to contribute.

What I'm trying to say is that this is not a full-time job. It is not even a part-time job. It isn't reliable enough for that. Please, please, PLEASE do not come into this expecting it to cover your bills. I saw people in the forums seriously worried that they couldn't pay their rent because they were EQ for weeks with no communication. This is a side-hustle at best. 
It's great for a PhD student like me, because I already have my expenses taken care of and could just use some extra spending money on the side. If I'm EQ for a month, I just put it out of my mind and it's no great loss. They eventually send me an email when they get their act together. If work is available, I can work however much I want at any time of day. It's very convenient for people with uncertain schedules.

If that sounds like you, then great! This is a good way to get enough money to buy a new hard drive or something.

"They do pay their contributors, and it is not an attempt to steal people's data as far as I experienced, I will give them that. But the overall experience there has gone way downhill in the past few months. Full disclosure, I was laid off a while back, but I can still be somewhat objective.
The work for 1099 contributors is spotty, there will be long times when there will be no work in your queue, and there will be no explanation as to why.
Don't expect to be trained on how to do your project, because that doesn't happen, ever. You are expected to read over a guideline sheet that can be very long and confusing, as nothing is clearly explained. And then, if you make a couple of mistakes, you can be pulled from the project with no warning.
Communication is not a major priority either, unless you have a really good person in charge, expect to hear almost nothing and the people tasked to try and answer questions are so overworked that if you ask a question in the online forum, it takes forever to get a response, if you even get one.
They do have a training team, but instead of doing meaningful trainings, showing people on projects how to actually do the work to meet expectations, they do more general platform trainings, which I did not find useful in any way, shape or form. The training team also seems to double as a defacto HR department in charge of coaching workers who the company says are not meeting standards, which can be problematic since the standards change frequently.
The culture there has changed over this year, it used to be a pretty good place, but that has been replaced by a culture that feels based on fear and intimidation, where people are afraid to speak up and they feel their jobs are threatened on a daily basis.
And while they do pay, you can see your pay rate get cut without warning, and the only recourse you have is ""take it or leave it."" Also, many trainings are unpaid (they say that up front) and tasks considered training tasks are often paid at a lower rate (sometimes far lower).
Bottom line is, you can make some money here, but think hard about trusting Outlier and going all-in, it should be a side gig, nothing else. And honestly, the constantly changing goals, deadlines, and being shifted between projects with no rhyme or reason is exhausting.
Oh, and one last thing, Outlier is directly asking contributors to write positive reviews on here, so take those with a huge grain of salt, as some people may feel they have to write them to keep their jobs. 

Response to Outlier: Fair point, I changed my review to reflect some people MAY feel they need to write reviews. But the fact of the matter is these reviews are not anonymous, so it would not be hard for someone to go through and read the negative reviews and see if that person is working on the platform. People feel intimidated by the culture at Outlier, it feels like your job is constantly on the line as you struggle to hit targets that are constantly moving. The truth is that right now, a huge portion of your workforce doesn't trust Outlier/Scale. If you are truly trying to change that, then that's good, but I don't think it will change, the system is just too ingrained, people won't give up their power, or what they think is power. 
I will offer a suggestion, revamp the training team, have them focus on working with contributors to actually learn the projects before they start work, it will be a much better use of your time and money than what you're getting from that team now.",They do pay their contributors-but the culture sucks,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672d05e81f81f83fa5d18a0d

"George sent me an email asking me to write a review. 

I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to warn anyone considering tasking for Outlier AI. I can't remember the last time I had such a frustrating experience with a company that claims to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence. Where do I even begin?

They advertise competitive hourly rates to lure you in, promising an attractive salary for your skills and experience. However, once you pass the assessment, the reality couldn't be further from what was promised. Despite agreeing to a certain rate, they constantly find excuses to pay you less—whether its project issues, billing issues, or simply offering ""less hours than expected."" What was initially pitched as a fair, well-compensated opportunity quickly turned into a frustrating cycle of lowball payments. It felt like a classic bait-and-switch move designed to get you on board, then nickel and dime you once you're invested. The whole experience left a bad taste and made me seriously question the integrity of the company.

The user interface is clunky and unintuitive. You spend a lot of time wasted on the platform waiting for bugs to be fixed. If you’re looking for actionable intelligence, look elsewhere. After weeks of back-and-forth with their support team, who are usually nonresponsive, I finally realized that they don't actually understand their own product. Scale has replaced American support with foreigners who don't understand the context.

Support is another nightmare. Every time I reached out, I got a generic, scripted response that seemed designed to avoid actually solving my problem. It took days to get a response, if I ever received one, and when I did, it felt like I was talking to a bot instead of a real person. 

The truth is the company has federal investigations and lawsuits mounting against them and this is their poor attempt at damage control. If everyone was telling the truth here, you would see 1 star ratings for each review. 1 star is the majority of these reviews, so take the hint!

In short, save your time and energy. You're treated like you're worthless when reaching out for help. Scale AI states that contributors are the cornerstone of the company.  What garbage.",Outlier AI: A Disappointing Letdown,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672cfb019d64204305c61f95

"Outlier has gotten better. Slightly. But. Particularly in its interface and also to some degree in its interaction with its independent contractors it has gotten better. However, there are still big glitches in its acceptance, onboarding, and tasking processes, some of which is the platform and some of which is necessarily the people administering the site and oversighting the work. There is also a problem with incentives being promised, verbally given, and disappearing. All traces of some interactions, including messages from Outlier during onboarding and assessment, and through the messaging system, can go poof and you won't find a way to retrieve them. Moreover, there is a ""Missions"" incentive program that would be a significant, positive factor if it were not for the fact the platform fails so that it becomes impossible to make those incentives. It has happened to me twice in a row, now. Or, the work suddenly dries up, but just over that period, usually over a weekend. That has a strong scent of deliberation about it, i.e., like the company is holding out that carrot, getting a little extra work done because of it, and then saying oopsie, sorry about the technical glitch but it was the weekend and we were all off, you know? Finally, they have no objective rules for review and less-than-perfect reviews can downgrade your pay or get you kicked off a project. And there are reviews which go to work you have never done, showing subject material you have never seen. And now they want us to leave reviews on Trustpilot to ""combat the disinformation."" Or maybe Trustpilot returns PII to their clients so Outlier can find and punish the people who have rightly called them out on their poor practices? Let's see ...

"I'm updating this review based on my experiences in the last three months. I initially gave Outlier AI four stars, but, sadly, I now can only give it one star.  Yes, it is a real company and, yes, you can potentially earn a good income if you are lucky enough to work a long-term project, but it is the most dysfunctional company I have ever worked for.  It also treats its workers very unfairly by forcing them to do many hours of unpaid training, often for projects with no work available at the end of the training.

Since the main project I worked on ended 3 months ago, I have been stuck in a loop of endless unpaid training followed by error-laden assessments. The creators and evaluators of those assessments frequently fail to follow the guidelines in the training materials. 

I've put a lot of time and effort into reviewing and providing feedback on the assessment materials (40-60 hours of unpaid training in the last three months).  Despite that, I have failed several assessments.  I have also passed several only to find that there is no work available. Why does Outlier force its workers to do many hours of unpaid training for projects that have no work available?  It makes no sense. Ironically, I am supposedly a top-tier worker (what they call ""an Oracle contributor"") based on the quality of my work throughout the year, but I am still unable to get onto a project where there is work available.

What follows is an edited version of the review I wrote 3 months ago.  It is based on my first 7 months working for Outlier when things were going well.

All Outlier contributors are considered independent contractors, so we are not guaranteed work, but during my first seven months with the company, the work was fairly consistent, and I worked around 20 hours a week.  As an independent contractor, you have to pay your own taxes, so be sure to set aside up to 30% of your earnings to do that! I think the IRS wants us to pay those taxes quarterly.

The job was not perfect, but for the first few months, I loved it.  Because I have a PhD, they started me at $40 per hour, but after a few weeks, they reduced the pay across the board to $35 per hour. However, they continued to offer good bonuses, so I was still able to average around $40-45 per hour.  That is great for a job you can do from home with flexible hours and as much or as little work as you want.  I believe the pay is based on your background and qualifications, so some people are only paid $15-25 an hour but others, especially those with a STEM background, can make up to $60 per hour.

I started as a writer, then became a reviewer, and later an editor.  I loved the main project I was working on.  I got to read, write, review, and edit responses (essays or short articles) on every topic imaginable.  The variety made it a fun job for someone who loves to read and write.

One of the company's greatest flaws is that it is that it is very bad at communicating with its contributors.  I was fortunate to work on a project that had a team leader who let us know what was going on for my first few months, but not all projects are like that. Also, if you don't have a project to work on, you don't have a team leader to communicate with.

There are other frustrations, such as getting incorrect feedback on your work from people who don't know the rules of English grammar!  Sometimes, you might lose an hour or more of work due to a platform error, and if you have not saved the ID number of the task you were working on, you won't be paid for the time you lost. Fortunately, that didn't happen too often.

For several months, I believed this was an ideal job for me because it was enjoyable and well-paid.  However, it is not a job you can rely on.  For a while, it was a great side gig, but I would want something more stable if it were my only source of income. 

In the last three months, though, it hasn't been a source of income at all.  It's only been a source of frustration.",A highly dysfunctional company to work for,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672ce6397212a65261d34367

I have been working on Outlier since May of 2023, and I can't express how grateful I am for the opportunities this company has given me. The work is interesting, the people are fantastic, and the pay is more than decent. The only thing that has made this a less-than-perfect experience for me is the general reviewing process of work, which sometimes results in poor scores that cannot be fixed.

"There are two main points I want to make:
- It is possible to have a good experience with Outlier if you do quality work (although a little luck may be required as well)
- It is in no way a scam or information theft scheme. It's fair to say Outlier has a lot of room for improvement, but the idea that it is a scam or some kind of scheme to steal information is just completely false.

Personally, I've had a great experience with Outlier for close to a year now. I've never had any kind of issue with pay or identity verification. I've been paid the correct amount on the same night every week. I like doing a variety of self-contained coding tasks on my own schedule and it works well for me.

I can't make any claims about issues that may be specific to working from outside of the U.S. I can only say that I've had no issues working from the U.S. and receiving payments via PayPal. There is an identity verification process that may differ from country to country, but obviously, it's necessary for Outlier to verify who you are for all kinds of tax and legal reasons if they're paying you to do work.

However, giving a full 5/5 would mean denying some very real frustrations that people do experience:

- Communication and transparency. Until you've stuck with the platform for long enough to make connections with others and build a reputation, it will just be you and a mysterious system that you don't understand. You may get moved between different projects every day with no notice. You may receive a generic email warning you that your quality is poor and urging you to read the instructions carefully despite not having any other indication of what you supposedly did wrong. You may have trouble finding an actual human to respond to you when you have questions or concerns.

- Unclear or out-of-date instructions. I've been on many projects, and the instructions always leave a lot of unresolved ambiguity and subjective interpretation. The instructions usually evolve and get updated during the lifetime of a project, but not all documents necessarily stay consistent with each other. The best thing you can do is read every communication channel and join every meeting or Zoom room available. You can't really get a full understanding of the projects without at least listening to questions that others have and the edge cases they're running into.

- The review system. Work goes through at least 2-3 layers of reviews. The reviewers, especially at the lower levels, are usually people who have shown a good understanding of the project and submitted good work themselves. In practice, though, this does not mean they are necessarily good, thoughtful reviewers. They may also become reviewers quickly and without much vetting if the project has a sudden need for workers at the review layer. Especially when combined with the previously mentioned ambiguity and subjectivity in project instructions, this means you _will_ receive some low scores on your work no matter how hard you try or how well you understand the project. There are always some bad reviewers active on a project, or even just good reviewers who make a bad judgment call occasionally.

This isn't meant to scare you away or anything, it's just meant to lay out the difficulties you are likely to experience so you can be prepared to deal with them. Especially early on, my advice is to absorb as much information as you can from all available communication channels and to not submit too much work before you've gotten some feedback to confirm that you're doing things correctly.","There are rough edges, but it is legitimate and improving",4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672c4c39f02a1dfb37efc895

"***Edited to add that the company is only asking contributors they think have had an overall great experience to leave a review, which is disingenuous!!!*** 

I have worked for this company for about 7 months; here is my experience. 

In March 2024, I was recruited to work as an expert in my field via Handshake for $50 an hour. I have a STEM background at the undergraduate and master's level. However, this offer was a bait and switch, as I was never actually paid $50 an hour. I submitted numerous support tickets and reached out to every manager as I was advised to do, but nothing ever changed. I was forced to work as a generalist for $15 per hour while working on the same project as other generalists making $30 to $60 per hour for the exact same tasks. 

The only positives I can give this company is that up until August, I pretty much could work whenever I wanted for however long I wanted on one particular project. Due to my quality work, I was quickly promoted to reviewer, and I maintained high feedback throughout my entire tenure on it. In August, after they rolled out project-based pay, I was dumped from the project without warning or reason. 

Since August, I have been thrown from project to project, or I've sat with an empty queue for weeks at a time. It takes me hours to do onboarding and pass assessments (ALL of which is unpaid!!!). Assessments have become increasingly subjective with paradoxically rigid grading standards. It's basically luck of the draw if I pass one. If I do manage to pass, the project is either EQ for weeks on end, I'm met with some ridiculously low tasking limit, or I am randomly dumped again without notice or explanation. Support is utterly useless; most responses are clearly autogenerated. Managers are rarely able to help. I have been unable to make more than $100 since August, and it's not for my lack of trying! Despite this being an experience I see many of us face, I still see Outlier heavily advertising for positions and onboarding thousands and thousands of contributors. It does make me suspect that it’s a data mining company in some way; I don’t mean our PII because that seems secure, but maybe what we put into the website. I can’t otherwise understand why you’d disregard your contractors so much unless you don't care about their “training” work? Why dump quality contributors from projects in lieu of people who barely speak English, then cry about the quality of the data generated? Why constantly shuffle people around and have a stream of new contributors all the time instead of investing in them to do quality work? 

The CEO of this company claims it is a meritocracy, but that has not been my experience at all. The lack of pay transparency, project availability, and reliability in even the website has been so disappointing. Outlier is not a gig worth your time.

"Updated review: I discovered Outlier AI several months ago and finally got an invite to join them as they were merging with Remotask, a similar AI trainer tech company. I've been working with Outlier for a few months now and I can promise you they are legit, they pay on time weekly for the work you do, and they are not in the business of 'stealing people's data,' a false claim that I've noticed in some forums like Reddit.

However, after working with them another month after I wrote this review, I have realized that they are just moving people around almost like chess pieces on a chessboard was seemingly no direction in mind as to where people should be. In addition they often experience extreme down time and technical issues that I would think a tech company in the middle of Silicon Valley would be able to solve in only an hour. It takes them an entire weekend to get their servers up and running again forcing them to put people on a temporary other project that pays less with higher metrics so that very few people can be successful. After some deep thought about the situation, I have decided to leave Outlier in search of greener pastures which I found when I found a company that offered me from 50 to $150 per hour for specialized work in my fields. Outlier has its positive aspects but all in all it has a lot of improvement to do before I would even consider doing even part-time work for them again. As I speak they have announced yet another downtime over the weekend where people had to be shifted to another temporary project that pays much less and where people are less likely to be able to please the client for some reason. They have other problems too such as the fact that some AI error bot comes up and tries to correct writers for what we write in the prompts and then people come along and tell you just the opposite. Then there's the thing about the reviewers not agreeing with each other either. It's all a pretty convoluted mess and sends mixed signals to the workers on a daily basis. It's a bit of a merry-go-round I have to say so in most cases I would steer clear of it. It's okay if you're just beginning to get into AI development but if you are a tech expert as I am or a professional in various industries you will want to look elsewhere for the long term where your talents are more appreciated and you are compensated better for your work and time.

"Been using the platform for 4(?) Pay periods now and it's been mostly fine. I've gotten shuffled onto 3 different projects at this point. The instructions have been clear and the pay has been consistent. Only issue I've had so far is the last project I was on had a lot of tasks and missions (which is awesome!) But then had a lot of issues with getting tasks to submit (being told to make sure everything is rated but it was and wouldnt submit or in one case not being able to do anything and seeing my timer counting down while I couldnt do anything) and then after having several missions expire/being forced to skip I was reassigned to the new project- which hasn't had any issues so far. The support was kind of helpful? They responded and let me know they were working on it and then essentially said I'm glad it's fixed, bye! Even though I didn't get the issues fixed. Other interactions with support was fine, so I wouldn't say it's super representative. Overall, it works (mostly) and they pay on time so it's honestly fine. Would perfer If it worked better, or being able to stay on a project long enough to get comfortable and produce high quality work, but that's me being picky lol. 

Update: shortly after posting this some weirdness happened to my que so I'm in one project but it's showing me as being able to task in another (dead links and all).

"I have been working for Remotasks/Outlier for almost 2 years. The pay didn’t start out so great, but has since gone up drastically. The work is sometimes inconsistent, BUT that’s the risk you take with 1099 gig work. I was able to save enough to buy a house the beginning of this year just from what I was paid on outlier. There have been significant improvements over the last few months, the one thing I dislike that has changed recently is the use of discourse instead of slack, slack was much easier to navigate and collect the information needed. I do also wish that onboarding was paid even at half the hourly wage or a chunk at that end. The hours spent on onboarding is significant and that’s a lot of unpaid time, especially when you have to onboard to multiple projects to hopefully get some work. ",Pros/Cons,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672bd465956191d32fc7cb7b
"I was hesitant about working for Outlier at first, as I wasn't sure about its legitimacy, and came to places like Trustpilot to see what others had to say. Ultimately, I decided to take the job, and 8 months later, I'm here to pass on what I've learned. There have been some hiccups along the way, but overall, my experience has been very positive.

First, the negatives. Work can be inconsistent at times, as contracts with clients expire, and you can be frequently switched between projects without warning. The most that I worked on a single project without any changes was roughly one month. Conversely, I also had a week where I was bounced between 5-6 projects, which required me to learn the guidelines for each, resulting in several hours of unpaid training time. Communication from management can definitely be improved upon, as you may be removed from projects without warning. Other minor inconveniences include receiving poor scores from reviewers without the ability to overturn them, even when the reviewers are objectively wrong.

With that being said, there are some tremendous positives to working for Outlier, which, in my experience, far outweigh the negatives. The base pay is solid and if you produce high-quality work, you'll have plenty of opportunities to complete missions for substantial bonuses. In many cases, these bonuses have effectively resulted in doubling my per-hour pay. The work itself tends to be challenging, but not overly demanding. Most of the projects I've worked on are actually enjoyable, particularly if you like searching for errors and improving quality. On some projects, you even get to write your own prompts with the goal being to ""trick"" the AI into making mistakes, which is both stimulating and rewarding. Finally, the pay is always on time. I've never had to worry even once about whether or not the money will arrive in my account; every single week, it arrives on the same day at the same time like clockwork.

In summary, working at Outlier has been a game-changer for me. If you have expectations of working full-time, your experience will likely be more stressful due to the negatives listed above; however, if you're looking to pick up an extra 10-30 hours per week (and sometimes more, if you like) as a secondary source of income, Outlier provides amazing opportunities. Personally, this side gig has allowed me to increase the amount that I invest/save each month, as well as pay for the occasional weekend trip that would have been difficult to manage with only my main job. It's been a great blessing for me and my family, and I encourage anyone to give it a try.

Also, wish work was a little more consistent, but that's more customer-based and out of Outlier's control.

"I've been doing this AI training work full-time for about a year and a half and making an excellent living each week, though projects can vary so some weeks pay much more than others, but it's indeed a livable pay.

Solid performance and quality work will get you promoted to more rewarding roles and bonuses.  Joining the meetings and keeping in the loop with project managers and the team for the latest project updates and instructions is crucial (and also keeps the work coming your way).

The platform's technical issues are sometimes challenging but it's come a long way since I first started, so it's a much smoother experience now.  I really can't complain too much compared to how much it generally works fine and pays well.

The actual work is usually not that difficult and often engaging and fun, though you should take care to follow instructions ""precisely"" and continuously review them to best align with what's specifically required for task quality. Look out for the ""most important"" details especially. Invest your time in studying the courses, really learn them, and you'll get the work.

Simply put, the work schedule flexibility and pay are excellent compared to other gigs - so I personally have to recommend this one! I'm very grateful this exists. It's legit, I've never had withheld pay or incorrect pay and time capturing. The support is also much higher quality today. If you love working alone, independently, and like to really self-drive your own schedule... this is a great gig for that.","A legit, flexible, full-time remote gig that pays well!",4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/672a86f2c01d4eab2a5a5aec
"Everyone has had different experiences at Outlier, some good and some bad. My experience has been mostly good since I started in March. The pay is decent, and I was able to make almost 30k in less than 6 months. There are times when project technical difficulties result in issues with proper credit, rating, or payment being given, but I have not had any issues in getting what was owed to me. The support team has been very helpful with most of my submitted tickets. 

Project leaders and admins notice when you do quality work because I was able to quickly move into Oracle, Super Attempter, and L10 Reviewer roles within many projects. It is important to note that you do have to be diligent in making sure action is taken with the things that are important to you. You just can't expect every person to have direct attention and quick resolution to every problem when there are thousands and thousands of contributors. 

Bonus missions are often given, which vastly increase your earning potential when you plan on putting in the hours anyway. 

This position is one as an independent contractor, so if you do not have much experience with that type of job title, know that you are not entitled to work consistently since you are not an employee of the company. But stick with it, make sure your voice is heard, and keep records of your work and progress. Many times, they will find a solution that fits your needs. The company is definitely not a scam, and I have enjoyed working with them and will continue to work with them as often as possible.

The onboarding process was smooth; as soon as my information was verified, I received access to the learning materials and could start working right away. The flexibility allows me to work in my spare time without obligations, which is perfect for my schedule.

Pros:
- They offer a wide range of expertise and projects, making it easy to get matched with a suitable project.
- Learning materials are readily available and frequently updated, ensuring easy access to necessary information.
- They provide numerous webinars to support project work.
- Payments are made weekly with transparent information, so you know your earnings as soon as you complete a task.
- You can now choose your preferred projects, giving more control over the work you take on.
- Occasionally, they offer special missions that bring in extra income.

Cons:
- There’s a lot of information to go through, which can be confusing.
- Many unpaid classes, quizzes, and webinars are required, which are time-consuming and don’t guarantee tasks.
- It’s possible to go over a week without tasks due to an ""Empty Queue (EQ).""
- Communication can be challenging, especially when it’s unclear whom to address for specific requests.
- You may spend hours working, but if the time exceeds certain limits, you won’t be compensated, which can be frustrating.

"I have worked for this company and its parent company for over one year. This is a legitimate company that provides in-depth services to AI providers. If you are hired, you will be working with AI models and doing a broad range of tasks, depending on your background and expertise. You are literally paid for the work that you do, and that is why I am providing 4 stars, not 5 stars. Although you will be hired at an hourly rate, this rate represents the literal minutes you literally spend working. This differs from hourly pay in other businesses, and you are also not on a salary, i.e. paid a certain amount regardless of how much or little work you do. Outlier hires experts and I am one of them. If you are an expert in a certain field, you can be paid very well.
If you enjoy a) interesting work; b) challenging and engaging work; c) good-paying work for extra money, Outlier can be a great choice. You can choose from a variety of different projects and types of work, depending on your skill level. 
Outlier is NOT a scam. I have witnessed the company go from a pretty basic level and having challenges managing a large, diverse remote workforce, to improvements every week in communications, training, and supervision. This company is improving all the time, not going backward. They are making strong efforts to be a good employer. That said, it's not full-time salaried work, so no one should go into it expecting that. 
I'm also going to note that I've referred others to the jobs, including close friends and relatives and most have not been successful in navigating the complex system and types of work - it is challenging.
Also, to be factual and respond to some of the other reviews, I'm going to reiterate - you are literally paid for the specific work that you do. I saw someone's comment about being in ""editorial"" for national magazines and websites, etc. and being disgruntled they were working with young people just out of school. The work level and expectations are more stringent (and yes - you will see confusing instructions, unfocused videos, and attend training that's not the best - no jobs are like that, right?) than ""editorial at national publications.""

The bad: It is part-time work only. Sometimes they run out of work for the reviewers to do. They call it Empty queue or EQ. It can sometimes feel disorganized and you have no one to ask about it. 

The ugly: The work is divided into projects and you have to onboard to each project. This is very tedious and then after onboarding you are expected to do assessment tasks at a lower paid rate.

Soon after, this task disappeared, and a few other tasks appeared, each requiring at least two hours of unpaid training. After finishing the training, I began working on the tasks. For one task, I worked for three hours. The system interface indicated that I had reached the estimated time but could continue working, although the pay rate would drop to $16.70 per hour.

"My experience with the company over the winter of 23 was fine. I was paid on time and made ok money. I then suddenly was not paid bonuses despite completing the required tasks. When I submitted a ticket for this I was told that I did not qualify for said bonus due to the time the task was completed. I then was rapidly given a bunch of poor performance feedback, and kicked off the project. For context the week before I was interviewed for a position because of my exemplary work quality. It has been all downhill from there.
They have since switched to a marketplace system where you are rapidly switching from project to project. They have also switched the pay rate. They will pay you a certain rate for the amount of time they believe the task should take. Then they pay you an additional time rate, which I recently discovered was $0. Essentially I was paid for 30 minutes for a task that took closer to an hour to complete. I filed a ticket and was essentially politely told that I would not be paid for the additional time spent on the assessment. Their new system is at best exploitative, and at worst wage theft. I would avoid this company like the plague.",Exploitative pay practices.,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/66fee4f71c486a0790f196f8

"I’ve been working with company for 3 months, and it works for me. But I also do understand why many rate 1 star.

1. Pay is task based. Yes, your hourly wage is set really high, but you don’t get paid for the actual time you put in. 

Each task has time limit, sometime 10 mins, sometime 120 mins. You must finish and submit it to get paid, preferably within the window. 

If you go over, the rate will be reduced down to the training rate for an extra couple of minutes, then the task expires on you. That case, you don’t get paid.

The tasks are not easy. But you get used to.

2. Assessment before each project. Projects come and go quickly. Your initial step to join the project is to watch the course video and pass the assessment test. Then you are allowed to join the project.

3. Quality Quality Quality. They check your work quality on every task, with many layers. If your work quality doesn’t meet their standard, you are done.

4. Payment system is preferable for US. I live and work in US, and never had any problem for the payment. They paid me even for $2. But some people live overseas, and those sometime run into a problem setting up the payment.

5. Not stable. It is great source of income if it’s your side job or something. Do not make this job your main income, because it’s not stable. Sometime you can keep working 24 hours, and sometime no task available.

Conclusion. This company is real and people are working. But this is not for everyone. This requires lot of homework outside of your paid time, also requires 100% focus during tasks. If you are homemaker with a lot of brain talent and skill, or are looking for something for sometime, then this Outlier is great for you.

"I’ve worked for them for only two weeks but it’s been fun, interesting and straight forward. It’s very simple- if you are honest and up to what is being asked of you along with a firm sense of understanding that this is not a normal workplace and the advantages (which are many) need to be weighed against the set up (which calls for calm, patience and good IT skills as it’s an online platform) this seems an excellent way to earn an extra income for people who have time at home. If you try and make this your main source of income you will (I believe in most cases) find it’s not compatible with very clearly spelt out rules of the site - the work can be sporadic depending on available projects and your own abilities.

"I have been with Remo/Outlier since 2022 and have had plenty of experiences with the company, both good and bad. 

Pros: When you have projects the income is endless.
There are good people within the company including other contributors, TL's, QM's, Admin's and so on who really do want to do what is right by both you and the company as a whole, I have made quite a few priceless friends via working with this company.
Weekly payouts are fantastic.
Being home for my family and still having income is a gamechanger.
There are opportunities to become an Oracle or other such level of contributor, but that comes with it's own issues separate of the normal ones.
Technical issues with the platform are quickly addressed and fixed (this does not include EQ or project issues).

Cons: Whatever they say you cannot make your own schedule. What this means is if you have a project and only plan on working 15 hours a week, good luck not going EQ or being kicked off the project.
Lack of transparency, project Admins seem to have no idea how to be transparent with QM's and TL's or contributors and in turn there is a lot of wishy washy behavior that goes on.
Great you have a degree but that doesn't mean that you will make $25+ like the other person with the SAME degree.
Long stints of EQ due to poor project instructions, horrible reviewers and auditors that seem to get away with murder, and don't bother messaging support you will get an AI generated response.

Really the only thing is enter with caution, make sure to read EVERYTHING document wise that you sign  and build a repertoire with other contributors and so on, so you always have someone in your corner. Also don't be afraid to be the squeaky wheel, even if this means going outside the platform to get your voice heard.

"A classic 'bait n switch'

Basically, Outlier.ai approached me on Linkedin, out of the blue. As requested, I sent them a CV and they invited me to onboard as a Tier 2 recruit. I filled in numerous documents and followed a whole a lot of procedures, admist which they tried to onboard me as Tier 1 -- at 10$ an hour less. 

Also, Tier1 deals with Log Tool parameters and techy stuff. If I'd known this I'd have never even started the process to begin with. 

All the above is factual; but here now is an interpretive thought -- do they also bait us by finding our interests/hobbies from our CV and profile, and then say there is A.I. work with just our speciality ? My MA Dissertation was in the field of English grammar and my interest is poetry, and they said there was opportunity for me here; but turns out they were largely going to use me for occasional 'micro-serf' grunt-work, such as checking the prompts and parameters of tool logs, the provenance of digital  images, and the relevance of URL links -- (with no more than a low-key and inexpert English-language role).

"There are 55 reviews at July 9th 2024 about this HORRENDOUS COMPANY and many reasons why they have an average rating of 1.7 out of 5, with 85% of those evaluators giving just 1 star. Please read on for my evaluation.

Outlier really do live up to the last two syllables of their name: they really are LIARS. The training they give you takes hours and hours with zero work for many at the end of it, even if you do 'pass' their Enablement Program which consists of a never-ending number of assessments! Look at the other reviews on Trust Pilot, many of which say exactly the same thing! 

LIE NO 1: I achieved 100% scores in each of their multiple assessments and was then told by a staff member via e-mail that ""your screening/ assessment results were not as favourable as we hoped"". When I questioned him, bearing in mind my outstanding assessment results, I didn't receive a satisfactory reply, only ""we don't have further details."" It seems really convenient that OutLIAR get masses of AI response evaluations from people wishing to become AI Writing Evaluators and yet they don't have to pay the $100 Celebration Reward to candidates who they have 'failed'.

LIE NO. 2: They also send candidates messages to say that their hourly pay is going to be reduced without any explanation as to the reason why. In my case, my pay was going to be reduced from $25.00 per hour to $13.27 per hour. This $25.00ph was promised to me before I started the Enablement Program and was the inducement to get me started with them. This had nothing to do with my so-called poor performance as my reduction in pay came on May 21st during my training ... while I finished the assessment process on June 10th. 

LIE NO. 3: Even if you do pass their Enablement Program and miraculously receive your Celebration Reward, you are NOT done with your training and will STILL have to do work for OutLIAR for free. When I submitted my last assessment, the automated message on the platform stated ""each additional project may come with additional onboarding materials and assessments"". 

Moreover, their customer service is simply awful. When you send a request to 'Support', they take weeks to respond and, in my case, simply closed the case as 'resolved' when it wasn't. I had to figure out what to do on the platform in the assessment phase myself.

Ultimately, avoid this company like the plague. My experiences are echoed by the vast majority of people who have submitted reviews on Trust Pilot. A 1.7/5.00 overall rating from 55 reviewers, with 85% of them giving just 1 star (no doubt many would have given 0 stars if that had been an option) tells you everything you need to know!

"Una truffa un po' sui generis, non immediatamente riconoscibile come tale: assumono facilmente (non esiste che non ti prendano, prendono letteralmente chiunque con centinaia di nuove assunzioni giornaliere, il che insospettirebbe già di suo) e in effetti all'inizio ti fanno lavorare e guadagnare abbastanza. Le recensioni positive che trovate qui, quando non del tutto false, appartengono probabilmente a lavoratori ancora in quella ""fase del progetto"".

Qualche settimana dopo ti ""promuovono"", e quando tutto sembra mettersi per il meglio, cominciano a ghostarti.

Il tutto NON basato sulla qualità del lavoro, come magari potrebbero dirti in fase di onboarding (personalmente avevo feedback e valutazioni eccezionali, da 5/5). In poco tempo ci si rende conto infatti che l'obiettivo non è la qualità del lavoro, ma il turnover continuo dei lavoratori.

I QM cioè i diretti superiori sono generalmente ragazzini con nessuna esperienza/competenza in merito al lavoro che dovrebbero svolgere, però sono ben istruiti/indottrinati/deumanizzati per cui non aspettatevi un loro aiuto reale, le domande ""scomode"" saranno tranquillamente skippate e qualunque problema, se riuscite a farvi rispondere da qualcuno (io non ci sono mai riuscito), verrà deriso, sminuito, ignorato o liquidato con un passivo-aggressivo ""non possiamo farci niente, ciao"".
Questa è la regola, non si tratta di casi isolati. Tutte cose che ho visto con i miei occhi, almeno finché non hanno avuto la brillante pensata di disabilitare del tutto i commenti su Slack, il sistema per comunicare con i QM – giacché probabilmente il dissenso e il malcontento cominciavano a montare e a costituire un piccolo rischio. Da lì in poi, le tenebre.

Ribadisco che questa non è solo la mia esperienza, sto riportando quella dei tanti colleghi con cui stavo avendo modo di rapportarmi, sebbene la solidarietà fra i dipendenti sia disincentivata attraverso un astuto meccanismo di ""persona diversa, problema diverso"": fanno cioè in modo che ognuno sia vittima di una diversa varietà di ingiustizie particolari, in modo tale che ciascuno si convinca di avere a che fare con un caso fortuito, e tutt'al più un po' di ""sfiga"", e nessuno pensi davvero che sia il caso di fare fronte comune contro un apparato strutturato per truffare.

Detto questo, onestamente non so in che modo possano guadagnare da questo meccanismo malato, ma è di tutta evidenza che il meccanismo esista e sia voluto, e che presto o tardi qualunque lavoratore assunto arrivi allo stesso livello di conflitto totale con la compagnia, e alle stesse sostanziali conclusioni. L'impressione è che per i più bravi accada un po' prima, e su questo aspetto non so proprio che cosa pensare.

L'alternativa alla truffa sarebbe una estrema, esagerata disorganizzazione e inefficienza su tutti i livelli, ma sinceramente, come detto, è un caos troppo totale, sistematico e sistemico per non essere in qualche modo intenzionale. Un casino del genere non può generarsi e perpetuarsi da solo, non in una compagnia da miliardi di dollari. Su Outlier, letteralmente, tutto è il contrario di tutto in ogni momento. Il sistema è chiaramente progettato per non funzionare, o funzionare in un modo e con scopi non intelligibili dal lavoratore.

They sent me a lot of emails pushing me to register.
I finally did it today, and provided my address, DOB, and Driver license. Then the process said Identity verification failed. So I used another ID - my green card. Then the process again said Identity verification failed and locked my account! I know for sure my both IDs were captured clearly and never has issue with other ID verification process. That's why I became suspicious and believe that Outlier has only one thing in mind: that is to intentionally and illegally collect my personal information and IDs.

"I don't believe Outlier is fraudulent or a scam. This company is just extremely disorganized and a bit unethical. They are also incompetent and cut a lot of corners. For example, the guidelines are written by people who do not speak English as a first language. Undoubtedly, they do this to save money. However, it creates a lot of confusion when completing tasks. The platform has several glitches because they use developers in other countries save money. Here is what you can look forward to working with Outlier:

1. You will spend more time on Slack than actually working. If you are offered $15/hour, it will more likely work out to about $7/hour because you have to hang out in Slack for free at least 8 hours a day to get updated on available tasks. They rarely send out emails with important announcements. 

2. Getting conflicting instructions from unqualified Team Leads. Instead of hiring experienced Technical Project Managers, Outlier often promotes taskers to other positions. These are stay-at-home mom types who have no experience working in tech. This is a problem because they don't have the skillset for the job and lack project management experience. I'm sure Outlier does this so they can keep them as contract workers and avoid paying benefits.

3. Attending hours of unpaid training for inconsistent work. I have attended multiple 2-hour long trainings only to still have no tasks available for days. It is common for them to say a new project is starting and ask people spend hours on these calls for ""training"". But it is not a real training, it's like they are gathering data from us. The taskers are usually the ones giving feedback on the poorly written guidelines to help them to improve. I think this is another unethical way that Outlier exploits people for free labor. 

4. Bait and switch on pay rate. Lots of us were promised $22+/hour and now make $15/hour without any explanation. I've received outstanding feedback on my work and I am constantly switched from tasker to reviewer on multiple projects but my pay rate has dropped instead of increased. 

5. Problems with payment and no response from support. I had an experience where they paused payment for several of my tasks to ""review"" them. It is now approaching four months and I still have not gotten a response to my support ticket or my payment.
 
The former CEO of Outlier is Sean Byrnes. Look him up and you'll see that he was a very experienced CEO and founder but left Outlier in 2022. Remotasks appears to have acquired the Outlier AI name to run from their negative reputation.

a. every day you log you find yourself assigned to a different category of tasks that require further knowledge to be completed;
b. they provide new informations related to the new tasks (that you need to assimilate, of course) but that time is not remunerated

d. the website responses and refreshing can be very slow and this does not help completing tasks

"Would give zero stars if that was possible. The company is clearly taking on too much too soon. Trying to recruit qualified individuals to train AI models before they have operations running smoothly. I spent multiple hours across a few weeks trying to deal with the glitches associated to verifying identity that was never resolved, i.e. I successfully verified my identify multiple times but it was never updated on the platform, and my account consistently said my identity was unverified. I wrote several issue tickets and received replies from someone on the back end to address the issue within 12-24 hours (good response time), however we went in circles back and forth and the issue was never resolved. Eventually, after unhelpful interactions I'm guessing the employee/s gave up, and these issues were ignored. I received one email about a project after all of this that asked if I was interested in receiving more information about it, I replied yes, and never received follow up. I was just curious about how that interaction would proceed but also  skeptical about becoming involved in a project before the issue of my nonverified identity was resolved -- i.e. if I work on the project with an unverified identity, there will be issues with receiving payment, so essentially one possible outcome would be that I would complete the 20 hours of work for that project and never get paid, and without the ability to talk to a human about it.

At first, it seemed like an easy way to make extra money, at first I was told that the hourly rate was between 25$ - 60$ per hour depending on experience. Later on, I found out, that it is between 25$ and 55$, So I booked their technical interview and got a coding question on Hacker rank, which is fine, the question was pretty basic to rearrange a sentence string in ascending order, and then I tried to write some code and pretty much anything I wrote there some kind of error, so in the end I commented out most of the code and tried see if it even runs code, just having a Console.WriteLine in C#, and it throws errors again, so the IDE doesn't even run a print statement. My advice is just don't bother with these guys. Complete and utter waste of my time. ",Outliers AI Techical Interview ,1,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/660132b425bca82e911243dc
"Recommended overall if you love a challenge.

But keep in mind (from personal experience):
+ They will accept you even if you aren't 100% qualified.
+ They will pay you the agreed hourly rate, including the time you spend training (if only once), 
     – but not the bonuses you've earned.
– And then they'll kick you out abruptly without explaining why (only saying vaguely that you violated their Terms of Use).

Expect shifting requirements, such as you've only just completed training for one type of task when they give you a different one. But that's part of the fun!",Recommended with caveats.,4,en,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65f511f7a6fee39e10af0132
